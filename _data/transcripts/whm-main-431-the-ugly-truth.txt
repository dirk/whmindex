thistles ahead.
Gum podcast.
This week on the program, he's playing another character named Mike.
It's the ugly truth.
Amanda Jube in American Steve's a Dag Chris happened.
Eric Ugly.
We ate movies.
Everyone.
Welcome to we hate movies.
Thank you for tuning in.
As always, if you are new to this program, it is a comedy show where we loosely talk about movies and kind of just make fun of stuff.
This week selection is, of course, part of the summer blockbuster extravaganza.
2019.
It's The Ugly Truth from 2009 directed by Robert Luketic, who, you may remember, a CZ directing gamboling thriller.
21 additional romantic comedy No one Saw Killers.
Oh boy, Monster in Law, Huh?
The I Saw it in the theater, Win a date with Tad Hamilton and and one good movie, Legally Blonde.
And now, before I'm asking everyone to put their tweet down, you're like, Oh my God, what is this doing in the summer blockbuster extravaganza it's doing here because it's really made $200,000,000 worldwide?
Yep, that's a blockbuster sounding title.
A ride it's Total Domain is doing here.
None of him to me, O.
M.
from me.
Nobody like to know what that means.
We should just shut it all down to 1,000,000 I guess for when this came out 10 years ago was fine.
But now it's trash.
Yeah, he is seen as a failure.
200,000,000,000.
20,000,000 worldwide.
A movie like this that costs almost nothing to make tops 35 lot of belt tightening green screen in this movie.
But you need 200,000,000,000 at the box office way got to break the record.
You got to be the best movie in June.
The best movie in early June, Maybe, baby, The best weekend, June, Where the President.
That piece of shit like whatever.
However, you can actually quantify beating a record.
And you're also always losing to Disney.
You, no matter what you're always going to lose.
And is he loses to Disney.
Absolutely.
It's Ah, it's box office cannibalism.
Uh oh, man.
And I was going to say something to your point, Steve O.
To your point, Steve, I can't believe there wasn't the uglier truth followed by the ugliest truth.
I think that's what killers is essentially going.
Doubles on Catherine.
Hi.
Go Get in Gerard out of there and put again.
And Ashton, that's a trade sideways.
It's not allow video.
It's Where does Girard Butler's so fucking awful in that?
Yeah, but I'd rather watch Gerard Butler be bad than Ashton Kutcher, B and anything.
It's one of those things where it's like, Oh, you know, you don't want to get Ah, you want to get your money back.
It was like a a dollar for dollar 50.
You know what you mean like that, right?
But it's not like this is like You get a dollar and dimes versus the dollar and Nichols, it's all really inconvenient.
Well, I just This is just making my pants heavy at this book.
Now I gotta carry around this pocket.
Fulla Girard Butler's I'm in Your Pocket.
This movie is he is a public access shocked Jack Talent it like it is kind of a person, and he gets hired on a local, uh, Northern California morning show.
There's a sacramental believe thes show is produced by Catherine Catherine.
Hi girls.
So it's really sparks fly, really her story.
It is a movie from the beginning on dhe.
She's just, you know, she has the worst life she's making probably, you know, decent.
Five high five figures.
Maybe.
Yeah, probably close to six.
Dating Kevin Connolly brief while she goes on a day with him.
I wouldn't I wouldn't want to find her life by that one awful day.
I will say, though I was pretty shocked.
Kevin Connolly is one scene in the beginning of this movie that I believe might even be before the title card.
Maybe not, but it's early on in the movie.
He's making the fucking opening scroll crazy, is it?
Is this a local the producer of?
Is it a little shit or is it a vehicle?
It's a local affiliate.
Yes, that crazy as this movie gets goes on that kind of crazy.
It's a local show because because it's so popular.
Yes, because of the things that sort of Craig Ferguson thing makes no sense.
Why you?
Why this local guy in Sacramento would get on Craig Ferguson makes zero sense.
Well, they say it's like a play that CBS is doing because they want them on their national shot.
So it's like I believe they refer to it as his audition.
Okay, you know, like if he does well, going toe to toe with Craig Ferguson.
So she comes in and she's like your classic lady movie archetype of I'm very uptight and I don't have time for a relationship, etcetera.
It's that I'm very good at my job.
She she's interviewing a bunch of fat weathermen at the beginning of like the weatherman need to be fat, she says.
Some, like a statistic about, Like When the Weathermen get it wrong, audiences are more forgiving.
If it's a fact I don't know about that, I would be.
I feel like if I gave bad whether people will be very upset with they throw a rocket your head.
I mean, they're just dancing around Al Broker in this.
Yeah, say a broker.
But this was also like years after he had that gastric bypass.
So, like the joke doesn't make any fucking sense.
He's been thin as a rail for life.
20 years as a rail.
Yeah, maybe it's a rake.
Have you seen our okay?
Yes, he's a slim man these days.
Is that like Sharpton?
He's an American slim, and you know she's like going around and like, she's got this assistant.
That's like this movie is a in search of a B plot like I'm glad I was only 96 minutes, but it needs a B plus shots there.
They didn't lean into that nephew Maura or something like, Maybe he's being picked on by a bunch of women at school.
It just eating something other than the two of them who have zero chemistry.
You would think something in the newsroom like would actually have to happen.
Well, they can.
I see her actually interview the fat man.
Maybe like the 9 11 happened during the Ugly truth.
It's like that.
Ah, Robert Pattinson privy to secret 9 11 for me whenever, Yeah, you don't find out.
It's set in 2001 until the towers go to like, What's with all these shitty cell phones?
Oh, yes.
So, like this morning show, it's John Michael Higgins on what's of Cheryl Hi are like a married news do, and that's your B plot, like give them or to do, because they're both the funniest people in your movie by a fucking mind.
The only charming parts of this movie is when you get to see the two of them improv ing with each other like that at the news desk.
There's clearly like John Michael Higgins and her just like throwing lines that or you get like, some state run offs.
You know, get yourself a Robert bed and Durant showing up some filter your movies.
Yeah, maybe won't do you, uh, do is, Is there a Corddry in here?
There's There's a lesser Corddry, which is really staying.
May Corddry played Neil Simon on that faucet Virgin Chaz Ebert.
Really?
He's fucking great on that, I have to say I watched the 1st 6 episodes that I'm waiting to finish it.
It's really great.
It's great.
Great fun.
Graphic.
She's great.
He's great.
The whole thing.
It's amazing.
I watched them.
Rock will not be in the clan for fucking a week and 1/2.
That's something, innit?
Well, you got that out of his system earlier this month.
Was that the best of enemies movie?
Okay, so there's a great script.
Am I in the clan or, um, I like eyes just like a nationalist organisation.
What are we talking about here?
Why am I and wait a second?
What am I doing in this movie in that movie?
He's in a hate group.
He's in the clan.
Yeah, he's like the head of the clan image, West Bentley or the head of the clan.
All those trailers were like, and it's based on a real Klansman.
Let's show the old guy from the clan where that guy's me fun and your grandpappy You can't see what Eric is doing the thing like you're on.
Ah, late night TV show and the The monitor comes down and he goes, Yeah, just this guy from the class.
Yeah, I'm looking to my right and like, up a little.
And it's true because I'm a professional.
Yeah, sure.
I understand how to do those movements on.
Okay.
Yeah, You know what?
I didn't realize that he plays C p.
L s exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux site.
They had all sorts of Cyclops is and wizards and shit.
You fucking egg Xavier's school for gifted youngsters.
Gifted racist youngsters, right?
Or gifted bigots.
But that's that's smoother like that.
I feel like if you went up to Edward Norton like, hey, man, do you want plan?
Not Thio.
Absolutely not.
I did that once.
You have never happening again.
Got it out of my sight.
Rockwell's triple dip it at this point.
Well, okay, wait, He's not in the clan.
And that three billboards movies.
Just a racist.
He's thinking about it, though.
He's got a pamphlet is being included.
Plan.
Cure, though sure is.
Have a little out of the closet.
It's It's three Billboard.
It's this.
He plays Cyclops and exulted Plan, movie, whatever that What was what?
What else has just think it's too?
He's also good stuff before.
No I But Steve, I thought you were saying he had 1/3 0 no, no, no.
I'm just double or triple it.
I you know, maybe that Ninja Turtles.
Oh, Poltergeist!
Oh, yeah.
Huge clan member dude.
That's why the Native American ghosts were going through a galaxy quest in a galactic clan.
Big Moon.
He's, like, racist against other versions of himself.
What'd you get a tan?
You piece of shit.
Just hanging out with Kevin Spacey and then, yeah, uh, this movie dates itself nicely.
Just affirmed 2009 ing right here.
They're like celebrity Chef is Rocco DiSpirito Yahoo?
You don't hear from any now?
Oh, he's a person.
He was a big deal.
You know what?
Well, the gig is in the sea and he's doing like celebrity chef on a morning show thing and like it's chicken a Cheryl Hi and eating chicken cacciatore e Delicious that he goes.
No, no, that's duck catch Hitori and she wants to throw up.
Trade up.
That's amazing.
That's great.
I was really confused What the joke was here.
What's going on here?
It seemed like there was a thing where it's like, Oh, Cheryl Hines famously can't eat duck.
I thought of food allergies, and I thought it was gonna be a joke.
That pays off for Catherine Hargo was you to elaborate on it in some way.
But it's just ignored.
Yeah, and she does a good job of like holding back her, discussed yeah, and getting through the segment and getting to commercial.
And then I thought the vomit was gonna happen.
But it doesn't know if somebody's gotta start up, especially doing an R rated movie.
Let's show it can be quickly mention the the little animated opening credit sequence.
It's not animated like an eighties movie, but, uh, crotch Yes, thank you, hard crotch.
Chris.
There's there's There's a figure of a woman.
Uh, you know, it looks like a bathroom sign.
Yes.
And it's got a beating heart on its right.
Yes.
And that's like women.
They like hearts.
And then when it turns into a man in the heart moves down to the dick, and it's just like men.
They got a heart dicks.
Gerard Butler comes out of his ass holes.
It's a weird Yeah, that's a weird little thing like, Yeah, it's like your hearts and your dick to your dicks in your heart.
Yeah.
I mean, they should then brains, maybe, Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be so brains and eyes like you're thinking with your other head.
Yeah.
Father said that to me one time.
He pointed to my forehand.
He said, Think with this head.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Dropped out of college, give you any condoms or No, no, no s.
So they're having ratings trouble.
We're told this by the station manager played by Nick Searcy from Justified Fucking love this, dude Big.
All the Red Bull product placement, right?
The middle of everything.
Lots of it.
Wait.
You have two people in this show passing notes right now.
Studio.
What do you fucking giggling at?
No.
Show it, Chris.
I did a cartoon of the crotch dick just as my note as my note from a prosthetic.
I was going because it's more of Ah, heart crotch.
Yeah.
I was expecting a picture of me with stink lines.
Like me with the witches.
Had a crotch stick when that Just be a dick.
Yes, I guess you're right.
Maybe like a heart dick like, Yeah, that's kind of I guess dicks are kind of shaped like hearts.
Heads would again.
I think we have to get you back in school with the doctor.
Do don't know one of the other triple bypass.
I sort it out myself.
Uh, S o she is set up on a date.
This is Kevin Connolly.
There's some sort of dating service with the fucking assistant.
This is also think this assistant, by the way, Judy Greer was like, It's 2009.
I'm above it.
Yeah, fucking above it.
How dare you even call me So they So they cloned Jody.
Judy Greer?
Yeah.
There was a Judy Greer certificate program that you were able to get in late 8 4009 that this woman got and put upon lonely assistant living vicariously through the star of the film.
And she said, Oh my God, he's a nine out of 10 in all of our categories Woo hoo Everybody which, like you don't get to hear what those are And come on smart Screenplay that Number one.
He's got to do this number and that's kind of the thing.
The other four.
Uncut.
This movie is so un specific in everything like we're in like you need to get there to understand half the stuff that's in your duck cacciatore e joke like, Well, that's a joke that needs to be submissive.
These air self defusing jokes is what happens.
They fucking fizzle out before they go on.
This is very weird for a romcom, but you can like smell.
Where the cuts were throughout this way was originally 100 80 minutes.
They would have had to defend something long in this for the catch Hitori joke alone.
But also for this, like Kevin Connolly being for one scene.
Yeah, and like you think he's coming back at the end.
Some reason I was at the height of his e power I would argue that it's too much.
Kevin Connolly Any Kevin Connolly is too much come terrible in this in like 30 seconds of this movie.
It was nothing.
Listen, I was impressed at how bad it was such a short little amount of time.
I mean, maybe he didn't want to.
The movie, who knows 100 cycles, just very professional actress.
She's doing exactly what she always does, which is they give energy to the scene in so, so, so much that deserves right.
And Connolly is just like, Yes, I would like a whiskey and she goes, You said You like red wine on your profile And he's like, Yes, I did, Yes, I did.
Also, Other alcohol's, that's all.
He's just like you're fucking crazy and no one my profile.
Yeah, I mean, she does have a print out of is a Fucking Printed and she says she ran a background check on it.
Yeah, because she says something about like, where he There's some, like, other fact.
And he's like, That's not on my profile.
And she's like, Yeah, but it wasn't your background check and it's like supposed to be a joke, but it's like Well, that's a horror movie line.
But I mean again.
And you're not working.
It's Jeremy Piven who's calling you a fucking bitch.
You gotta hug it out with him.
It's like on actor that needs a little more from you allowed anywhere you don't even like.
So you need to escalate and be like, Whoa, what do you tell you?
Read a background check on me?
Well, dude, it's Kevin Connolly, man.
He just bro's out with whoever is doing the Vulcans scene with.
I do appreciate mentioning another cast of Entourage.
Sure, Kevin Dillon would have nailed this.
Definitely.
You get Kevin Dillon.
He like, Yeah.
Hey, but what he would do?
Like what?
His eyebrows, The eternal it You get fucking eternally in this bill.
This thing, Colonel, with Slade, Do you want down?
He quit fucking turtle soup of this scene.
Both of them would be down for it, though.
Yeah, well, yeah, exactly.
Connolly is bailing.
Funny enough.
You know who'd fuck it up?
Mark Walberg.
Wait.
You ran a background check on me and then I punched her in the face.
What?
Walberg, You tell Mark Walberg background check.
It keeps looking behind him.
like what?
Yeah, the extras look good.
Chicken the background.
What are you talking about?
Fucking fine.
Just like they were.
The last time is Mike, Is Mike back there?
Michael, I'm gonna walk from this movie.
The ugly truth.
Adrian Canary would have fucked it up to anything.
Yeah, I definitely think I was a waste.
I saw him in, like, one of our like, Williamsburg haunts.
One time I was really worried that was going to be the end of the bar.
I think I remember that.
Turned out okay.
Though.
He left, I think he realized he was in the wrong spot.
I think he saw me specifically.
The gather need to be here.
This is a bar full of turtles.
This'll places lost.
I needed Vince bar.
This is a toe.
I found a turtle bar.
Oh, sorry, Turtle Barbie.
When you guys go back, it's eternal bar.
I fucked up.
I read it wrong.
It's a turtle bar of so, like whatever.
The day goes poorly, She goes back home.
She's got a cat.
Adorable cat named D'Artagnan was big into this cat.
Good.
Katarina, The cat is the catalyst for the whole fill.
It away because the cat like steps on the remote control.
And it turns to Girard Butler's show The Ugly Truth on local public access.
And it's set up like Adam Corollas Podcast studio.
He's got a lot of fucking bobbleheads and bullshit.
Yeah, in studio toilet waste of fucking mental asylum.
That's where this way look, this guy is has, like, a ah black lodge fucking curtain behind him, and he's just screaming into a microphone.
Kevin, I don't watch in public access, man.
That's like 90% of it.
Oh, that's the weird thing is like screaming in front of curtains.
But Jesus is involved.
That's what drives me nuts.
Like, that's what public access is all about, right?
Yeah.
I prefer, you know, the kind of public access I like.
I don't know if it still exists.
Remember when they would just broadcast like, traffic cameras throughout the city?
Oh, yeah, I remember that channel.
Ah, it was like watched it if you know, you had, like, non cable box cable, like you just flip it.
They're all like, whatever those digital channels were floating in the traffic update or something.
No, it wasn't any updates.
It was just literally traffic cameras throughout the city like they had one in Times Square.
There was, like one on the Grand Central sitting there going like you could actually kill that girl pretty much, do you?
Wait.
You tried to see if anything happened if anything went down like a car accident.
Nice.
It's good that people who are shut in experience going out on a Friday night, my friends in Times Square, the open road bridges.
Come on.
It's great for those people.
So she, uh, she's watching it and like, then cannot be trained.
Oh, you've got your books.
Chicken soup for the soul.
Men are from Mars.
Women are from Venus.
It's all crap.
Here's my advice.
Get skin A and that's kind of it.
That's pretty much it.
She winds up like calling in, and they have, like, a fucking phone fight on the air.
But to be fair, did anyone else notice he gives 2009?
He say someone look like Shrek does.
He generally does.
That's the same.
Yeah, he's some some lady guy gets calls him before.
Yes, it's probably because you're no no, he just said he just calls her Shrek like Goodbye.
Sure, Yeah.
Bye Bye.
Shu egg.
I read You know that the whole of performances offensive honestly, as a Scotsman who is used to be an old Gunnar, that's offensive.
Ah, And yet, like I set up top, his name is indeed Mike in this movie.
Also Mike Chadway.
But he's also pulling this that we're doing the Gerard, but their voice.
A bad version.
But he's pulling this back and kind of flattening at his best.
It is atrocious, you know.
It's like it's hard.
This guy's not American.
I don't know if he's Scottish, but he may be he's from outer space is the vibe I loathe.
John Mulaney bit of like a horse in the hospital like this voice is a horse.
Yes, exactly.
It's just like, what do you do in there?
Because, like this is like only a couple years after 303 100.
He's like he's just Scottish.
Is the Scottish Greek father Yeah, e.
I mean, listen, I know that, like thing is hard to cover up.
That's fucking thick again.
Just mention the quickest detail about like you came here in college.
That's it.
There's one line where somebody I think her assistant is telling the captain Hydraulic Oh, he came over.
He he moved here just in general when he was 10.
But it's not like you don't see where he is from.
So what?
And it doesn't make any sense because he is a cyst during this movie.
Who's not Scott all well, things.
He moved here when he was 10 with just $5 in his pocket.
Look what he did, what he became today.
That's a hard working immigrant.
After 10 years of sleeping in a lion's jaw, I mean, what, uh, he's so this show is like he's basically doing like a show.
Venice took Howard Beale like he's just yelling at the television about how men can be trained and he's like, You must be a dog.
Just this fighting with her on this fucking show he has is straight out of YouTube's alright wormhole.
Of course it is like this is what I like.
2009 were portraying these male Shah Veniste's as being like charming date material.
Major popular culture $200,000,000 might think like Mike.
Sir, Novich has this movie on DVD.
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Cause I'm sure they all have terrible taste.
Always got this.
And magnolia dollars.
Usually Julia seems very This reminded me of Magnolia with Tom.
He's like a Z grade Tom Cruise in that movie.
Fuck the frogs that fall in love.
This guy?
Oh, no, me father's dying, if not gun to stop you.
Gerard Butler driving around in the frog raid just turning on his windshield wipers.
I would love him to, like, talk up William H.
Macy in that movie like you wanna fuck that bartender?
Go fuck that, Barton.
Don't let the guy from the burbs steal him from you.
Oh, wow.
From ye Yeah, that long intro with Supertramp and not William H.
Macy, but Gerard, But yeah, passes.
Look, yet a good looking guy, the places that were dead but their word Get out.
I've got to re watch that movie, man.
I haven't seen a really long time moving eso lo and behold, The next morning she goes to work and Oh, Nick Searcy has hired this dude, I guess in the middle of the night to come on and do the fucking ugly truth on the television program because yeah, he's like, Oh, this guy gets good public access ratings were Who is looking at those numbers?
Who's keeping those numbers?
How do you quantify it?
I don't even I don't think you do.
It's like I think they say, like every 20 minutes.
If you're watching this, please call in.
Let us know you're watching us.
We're trying to keep a tally of how many households they do say that their new stations ratings air so bad The toilet?
Yeah.
Reruns of whatever are doing better.
So Oh, yeah, there was the boss was the joke.
Yes, there it was.
I was gonna say there was kind of a joke in there because he's like, it's the episode where the vacuum breaks.
Yeah, and he comes in a week living about like, all these guys like you.
Like your I mean, I guess it's more honest now because, like when you're those guys again, Mike, certain images or whomever, you have to live that all the time.
Because people are like keeping tabs on you.
But like, none of these guys were really that way.
You know what I mean?
Like the bike goes off in the ghettos.
Yeah.
The Microsoft Man count shuts up exactly.
Howard Stern was never who he was on the air.
Like, you know me.
Like that was the gag.
Yeah, also you can.
I mean, at this point, I don't know if that's necessarily true in 2009 but at least at this point, you can't you make more money not taking a big gig like this.
Yes.
And just doing your online thing and like that would have a premium.
Like Snapchat or something.
I don't think that was, like, you know, happening now.
I think we did YouTube for like, what two years was It was maybe six, but not a long time before making you're making money off way were uploading old fucking toy comer.
In that sense, an estimate.
But these people are actually who they pretend, right, But Gerard Butler would be be kicked off a Patriot point.
You don't know.
Fuck it.
I'm leaving pastry on players donate to me, pay power.
You think it's because the racism but it's really because of all the XXX material he puts up there to be fair, not a racist in this way.
Not that we know there's no black people in this movie at all.
Question Mark.
Uh Brown.
True.
Now that's not true.
You have.
I mean, working the offices.
You vet Nicole Brown.
Okay, so I mean, one person with one line, maybe.
Or are people She's kind of out as many lines.
Nate Corddry.
That's just like people that work in.
Yes, the news office or office sort of there.
But they just don't matter.
That's Listen, I'm not saying it's a fucking diapers.
Robust cast around to saying that the good place she So she's very against it.
And like she even out yourself, which I would never do, she's like, Well, I called your show last night, Mister.
Mister.
Yeah, you're pretty in Paterson.
What?
Now?
The move is just to suddenly change the timber of your voice.
Yes.
And suddenly become like a different bird.
Yeah, like, oh, are nice to meet you.
And everyone could be hired.
Katherine Hart bowled out for the rest of it.
What is she doing?
This is how I've always talked.
Quarter.
You're talking.
Oh, you guys are so funny saying that I didn't talk like this.
He's got a tough tapes over.
This is weirding me out.
Don't always talk like that, E I guess maybe the elevation years pop.
There's a couple of, like, pretty rank lines here that he's got when they meet in the studio.
She's like, Oh, I'm your producer.
What I say goes a good I like a woman on top.
And then there's another bad one where she's like, Yeah, I tuned into your show last night blah, blah, blah And he's like, Oh, thanks for watching or whatever, and she's like.
And by the way, like the end of the conversations like the Black outline is like, I didn't have your show on Mike Cat accidentally changed the channel to which he responds.
Then you'll want to thank your pussy fart on me.
Yeah, that I remember that.
They're really funny.
There was something when they when she called the show and was talking about like the ideal man.
Yeah, and she listed all the attributes, which is like a dude that's like not a scumbag drinks wine or whatever is like that doesn't exist.
You all you want a game and he doesn't couple of that.
If anyone, even like, reads a book that the gay is due to the gay world.
I feel that's true.
That's straight out of Corolla country.
Yeah, that's right.
I mean, that guy's probably like that all the time, but like, and that's it.
But that's the thing is like when she's like, I'm your producer.
What I say goes, Okay, cool.
Very nice to meet you.
You know, I'm gonna do this whole shtick where I, you know, talk about record window.
Oh, by the way, like a person, I like the color people.
We understand that he's supposed to be this way just because this is what the characters.
But the point is, the movie yeah, is like, get ready for it, everybody, because soon enough she'll find all this charming because he certainly doesn't change.
One Lick wants to deal with it.
It's just the entire world around him also becomes to de way neither of them really come off as characters.
Really, they don't do much outside of like, meat and dislike each other and then like each other.
But it's high calls movie and like even that she's like the buttoned up career woman like She doesn't have specificity so far.
As like, you don't even like none of this we never get a 10 criteria We never understand.
Like what her goal is.
What?

But they're all where you keep the prostitutes while I wait for me eggs way, Kevin said.
It's a diner, hookers, or it could be anything he would just be walking in and asking them where they were.
Prostitutes might be very meta human eggs.
Could you blow me where the Panthers is?
Ther this is a state farm.
This kid's got six lines and the mom has, like one.
And that is it for the whole fucking the mom's story.
What?
Yeah, well, oh, you know, your uncle is just such a such and such and such.
And that's it.
And we get back to Captain High Angle.
Who's low?
Wait a second.
Sorry, there's a bad joke here because it's 2009 and I guess we're still using these.
The answering machine gag where he's like in his fucking bachelor pad above the garage.
Allah, Arthur Fonzie.
Rarely wherever this well, to be fair, up to it, including, like two weeks ago, he's being look access, right?
Yeah, right.
Which is I don't think any money.
No, no, it's a hobby.
Insulting women is a hobby.
Free drinks at the worst bar.
But he's checking his messages and just one after the other.
Like who?

I mean, we're not doing that.
Still, are we?
I guess.
I mean, I don't know, because he's, like, unemployed.
So maybe the jokes, like he's got old technology or something.
I don't know.
Or maybe because the silence keep invading.
He own grades is that makes sense.
Won't come alive and kill him, right?
Exactly.
That makes sense reference.
I wouldn't get so way.
All but all of his paper for shows have it has cut the ends so that it's not like it's a perfect trying our wreck tickle.
That's just like a Mexican piece of paper.
Those hexagon pieces of paper of a no fuckin said they have a sheet of paper.
I love that show.
More than life itself, though Made knows that.
But if you developed outside of Earth like it's separate planets, they just, you know, you just don't care about efficiency it all now or cuts eight.
You know, maybe they make little footballs out of the sides that cut off well, there.
Yeah, makes.
But like Ben Franklin instituted that we'd all be doing all that turkey fucker.
Didn't care about cuts of paper.
Dude, that dude was asylum.
That dude would be cancelled, by the way.
How do?
Definitely so.
She's like spying on this dude across the way whose naked cause, like her cat, got up a tree.
So then, like she gets the cat and then it's like, say, I heard pornography.
Music starting better Look around.

Yeah, Yen.
And it really is pretty jaw dropping like steaming, steaming little piece of beef.
It's totally fine to have.
I don't know, but this has a lot of lines in this movie.
Like you could find a fit comedic acting.
Years of a Paul wrote in there a Ken Marino baby.
Someone thinking, Marina, you're not getting a Paul Ryan being literal.
He has about as much like dramatic energy as a side of beef.
Not very a scene.
What's No.
He's just like I'm good looking.
I'm a doctor, like check off the boxes on your sheet.
The flap.

You do not say Yep.
Oh, and Harold and Kumar escape from Guantanamo Bay.
Who did he play?
A guard.

Original programming don't do not steal suits.
Valor.
I just was promoted in my feet is like the final season of suits, which I think the only reason that these they're like giving the show a swan song is that they could show Meghan Markle clips like, really remember, remember?
Yeah, totally.
I think they'll have a character like, have a car bombing or something.
Catherine.
Hi, girls.
Trying to figure it out along with the titular suits.
Wow.

Royalty on that show.
Absolutely duty.
Kidding me.
Characters and royalty.
Welcome on the USA.
Now we're paid royalties to Royal.
There's another show.
Royal Pains.
Remember that one?
That one can't.

No one married into royalty on that.
But in that run for like you say, they all run for 140 years.
It's all secret television shows.
What was monk like?
11 season may well be surprised.
I couldn't imagine that Harry guy acting now.
Although I did seem act a little bit when, uh when he went to Afghanistan and pretended to be a fighter.
That was God.
If you were a little fun helmet?
Yeah, he was just like, Hey, I'm just like you guys know you.
So anyway, she falls out of this tree, She gets stuck, the dude comes out, towel wrapped around.
She's freaking out.
He's trying to help her, and she, like, rips off this towel.
And she is face to Dick right here.
Yes, that's right.
And there needs to be some kind of a joke here.
Yeah, she sort of just, like, covers up her face and they don't acknowledge it all.
There has to be like, Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, and then he's got to be reacting.
Yeah, there's just nothing.
It's smooth.
Is a kneecap down there?
Oh, no, right.
That's what makes him joke about, like, a wax job, a nice wax job, anything a ren and Stimpy bad smell, noise, cheese, Dick eso Mike is an instant sensation overnight, some might even say, And like she's trying like she like, she has a tentative plans of the doctor.
She calls him the next day.

I'm a fucking hit.
And she's like, Oh, but blah blah.

He's dotted bia because you're a fucking needy and wind and like the idea that she calls him.
And like he puts on hold, he hangs up on Listen, you've got hope, little I'll make a deal with you, which makes which kind of makes this a movie, but isn't a movie which is like, basically, the dealers.
If I help you get this guy, you'll stop being shitty at work, and it's not like it's not.
You have 20 days, you have 10 days.
No, you're right.
It's very low stakes.
I guess this is what the movie's exactly.
That's the deal of the movie, but the movie needs a deal to be a movie.
It's like half, uh like Cyrano de Bergerac.
Half like she is.
Elisa do little.
Basically, there's no sense of place like that's like exactly like any sense of what the newsroom's actually like.
Toe work there.
They're just there to argue with each other, and it's a place where they argue with each other, and you don't really get to know what the whole thing is other than small snippets of Cheryl Hines and fucking Aah!
John Michael Higgins right on, because I guess this movie was written by Al Bundy or Al Bundy did a pass on the screenplay.
Maybe his.
His first segment after he's a huge hit is Jell O wrestling with babes in a pool like Ted Bundy dinner.
It is incredibly vile and shocking leave.
It's just like the whole notion of like a Jell O wrestling.
It's just like such a played your uncle wrote Nineties Gates.
Disgusting.
It's like a John Waters.
Seen that yellow looks like jelly but looks really gross.
Get off.
Oh, that was throw Betty because she's like, All right, she's in the control room.
All right, fine.
If we're gonna do the fucking we're gonna do it right, we're gonna go for her and she gets, like, on the intercom.
And she's like, put her finger in your mouth now.
Yeah, and he's like, part of that May, and he doesn't yet.
Oh, I was wrong.
It was cherry flavor.
When I get jerkoff instructions in the ear piece Ah, shit.
My my Adam pods it in me.
Hit foods evident things backwards.
She has that bullshit nightmare.
We're like, she's a naked weather girl.
He's like the king of the network or whatever.
These are more cartoon fucking things, right?
Because he's got like cartoon clouds over boobs, and then she's like, Oh, the low pressure system is gonna go down here and I mean, like, That's not funny But it's fine if you know what she's actually trying to do.
If she's like, I want to win a fucking Ami because I want I want hard hitting news I want I want make to make people feel warm and nice inside or whatever right?
Whatever her ambition might be, there's no stakes because, like she's presented with the low ratings, she's like kind of doesn't care.
Yes, she's like, Oh, I'll think something up in all of our ideas are terrible cause she doesn't put anything into it, right?
Well, she also mentions like she's already an award winning journalist and blood blessing.
Yeah, part of it is like she's over with it, But yeah, it should be like a She's trying to get to the next level of the network.
Whatever it is, she has no goals other than, like, somebody fucked me.
But also like the whole idea of like, Oh, man, you know what?
People want to watch it.
Fucking 9 a.m.
Is fucking Jell O wrestling, which is no one right way too early.
And that told demographic, is older female older women, you know?
I mean, like, that's why those shows are what they are.
Sure, sure.
But there's an audience.
Oh, they're out there at night like theirs were desperate loners.
Yes, there's teens very to work the night shift, who are always at the bar when you're going a work.
Yeah, passing out to the news before you ever watch commercials and they're really specifically tailored.
And you're like, Well, I shouldn't be watching this.
I was like, uh, used to have this TV over here, which is we'll watch two o'clock in the morning with a bad movie or something.
And it was all the commercials were addiction based.
It was those that I used to do crack cocaine, and now I don't.
And I'm like, Well, I'm not doing that.
I would if it was here.
It's like after um, like the like, the newsmagazine shows at night, like on MSNBC.
Once they hit the last one, they just start replaying prime time.
And when you hit those commercials, I think I instagrammed one of these one time.
It was so fucking hilarious.
It was this guy and he's like, Yeah, so I'm really happy with my new evergreen catheter, you know, olders catheters and he just this guy saying Catheter like 1000 times this ad.
It's the funniest.
The one with me is commemorative coins.
There's leg by them, and I'm like, This is not for me And you know this much like an old Johnny Carson.
And it's like the whole, like, two minutes of a commercial breaks like you ever get your catheter stuck in the door?
Never hit a door knob on your fly Prez.
New coffins.
There's also stuff like I saw one recently, which was fucking great.
It was just like, You never know.
You ever have you paid in the life insurance.
You could sell your policy and not get any money when you die.
But it doesn't matter because you'll be dead.
There's I was actually just visiting my folks last weekend and my dad big this TV head, uh, because they spin all his favorites.
Dude, Hogan's heroes.
I believe you had some Perry Mason on there.
A lot of the old shows, right?
So there we are, watching Hogan's Heroes and It's like, Well, clearly, if you have this on, you've probably served in the military.
Something relic.
Military family insurance.
It's a It's a faster way to fold a tri folded flag.
It's like it's an automated way for your funeral.
To make it out of my favorite.
One was a was a steel build.
It was It was there was a warehouse somewhere where somebody bought a bunch of steel sheds and it was And the idea was, uh it starts out with this guy that I bought my steel shed and I love it, and it's like for your backyard or whatever.
Oh, I'm pretty sure I've seen this, and the thing is, no reasonable offer is refused, but I always love that I What is a reasonable offer in this situation?
Well, I think it depends upon how big the steel shed is, because you got to start from there.
But I like my first thing I would think is reasonable.
It was like a maybe like the mid size one.
I don't like $300.
Yeah, that's a steal.
What about, like a length of tubing that I have in my house?
Is that a reasonable offer.
We will come by and take your copper, right?
Definitely on these adverts.
Did you could be fucking bartering with them?
Three easy payments of whatever's in your garage.
You will strip the copper out of your house and take your dog, but we will leave you, is still she All right.
We will leave you a steel shed if in return, we get six chances this summer to swim in your pool, there's more copper in your house that you no way confined in all kinds of places.
We've been watching your house, so that's the sort of low stakes deals like I will help you get this guy if you stop fucking around at work, right?
Okay.
I'm like, it's like eight.
Kevin huddles a really beautiful woman, a number one.
So she's, like, ahead of every game.
You could be a head of A and B, she's successful, but like, it's like she's never gotten laid before.
Which is this weird thing.
Like she's never gotten a man in quotation marks.
Doesn't she tell him it's been 11 months and she had sex that that long?
I mean, it's a long time, but like what are we talking about?
Also, it's a lot.
Is did anybody else knows that?
Like, she just kind of forgets who he is every time they split apart.
Drug butler.
Yeah.
Look, every time she like, he'll say semesters.
Oh, my God.
Again with this, like, this is a continuous thing.
This whole care, everything like it just, like, starts all over again.
He's tells her this is this is And listen up, folks.
Who This is some sage advice when they're about to get, she's about to go on a date with this doctor.
He says that you have to balance the saint in the center with the librarian and the stripper.
Yeah, great.
Thanks a lot, man.
Cow.
Well, this was this is a weirdly r rated movie, because no reason I hear the first fucking Oh, uh, that's the fuck of the movie.
And it's so weird.
I remember when it hit and I was like, Well, I guess you got it in, like, 20 minutes in the movie.
And then we were like, You got it.
He goes like a store.
And he's like, Oh, you know, I'm successful in well, and, you know, Well, uh, well connected.
Most of the young men like that, but they don't want to fuck it.
Yeah, and then she mentions, Like how she met that doctor.
Yeah, he's like, Oh, doctor, that just means they put fingers up.
But she's like, she's like, Yeah, he's a doctor.
He's like, Oh, doctor, you know what that means?
And she's like, Ah, successful, you know, has a lot of money.
And he's like, No, he had to stick his fingers up some guy's arsehole in med school.
God for B like Lord Almighty.
What is this guy's problem?
He's Adam Corolla in a movie.
I think he hasn't gotten laid in 11 0 at least Gerard Butler, Uh, this answer inside of us.
It's all it's all sexy.
Lady is calling you, but you can't call him back.
What is this fucking front he's putting on?
Like you're really secure and content in your sexuality or whatever.
You're not barking at women and calling them, you know, if you paid $12 a month on partner, get Jericho off instructions on your accident machine.
Oh, great.
Now to the weather.
So she goes out on a date with the doctor to a minor league baseball game and a Bluetooth in her ear like we are serious.
Is your Honor de Bergerac.
Absolutely.
George Butler is like a couple of sections away.
I think this is after this dude comes to her house.
Yes, toe like talk to her and their plane like don't answer the door right away, right?
And then when she finally does, you could clearly see Gerard Butler like, oh, pumpkin over the couch.
Think guy Caesar to he sees it and he says nothing.
And I'd be like, uh, ma'am, lose a murderer in your apartment.
There's an abnormally large Scott spit over there, but they are kind of playing this dynamic that, Oh, she might be seeing someone else try to make this guy interested.
But like, she's talking to you and there's a dude listening.
Yeah, hiding under the couch.
Be into couples you don't know which would be fine if they would explore that.
Come on in and cock me girlfriend.
I guess he'd be getting They're all getting cut, But I mean, I just feel like if I open the door and there's a dude in the Hi, I'm here for the gangbang Exactly.
It's sort of like you just get that energy.
Like, have I'm giving off dude energy behind your oven, like, nor its Okay, I've given our advice to fuck you.
What makes it worth it?
Makes it so much.
If I was in a relation with somebody and I found out they were getting advice from Gerard Butler, The time what I have done.
What was I Was I just a bet aside Just a fucking bet to you, man.
I was Shoe's on the other foot.
See?
Nobody likes it.
Nobody likes being stupid.
Bet.
At least she's all that.
There was, like, a legitimate bet there was.
Yeah, I have no idea what the wager is in this movie, but somebody's gambling.
So they go to a minor league baseball game.
He's again like she has never talked to a man in the whole fucking life, I guess on like she needs a fucking ah, Bluetooth, where he's, like had do this.
It is like, Hey, put that hot Duggan yet both and work.
So the dog is a men like to watch woman put phallic aya visiting their marathon.
It's like a you don't need someone to tell you that.
And also you need a voice this conference said that voice in your head to be like, Oh, that, like maybe he'd be aroused by this, but it's wildly inappropriate.
Listen, it is the final league baseball game, and you are at a minor league baseball game, the family friendliest of sporting events.
Wait till the fireworks before we start slow lately.
Hot.

Wait till everyone's distracted before you pull that move.

Everyone turn around.
Stop.

Oh, because I think he says, like something else like, and that causes her to drop out because she's got the fingers like, Oh, and she just It hits the floor.
But part of it hits his pants, and I was like, Oh, my pleated khakis And it's like, Oh, let me get this stain out And she's like rubbing this stain out.

It wouldn't be appropriate that you're about to describe a crime.
But if he if he offered, he was like, Why don't I buy you something?

There's a long would he called their montage of them like right, that Natasha Bedingfield song their cabin.

No, it's like animals put together and they have bumble bee wings.
Little was it's a jelly fish.
I just learned Buffalo Bill.
Ah, but the Tahoe trip has to be canceled because we're told he's gotten this job off her to go to an affiliate in San Francisco or No, this is the This is the national gig.
He's flying to L.
A to be on Craig Ferguson.
And Craig Ferguson is gonna be like, basically his like, backdoor pilot into being on CBS.
The idea and he got on.
And like the guys that we can't lose this guy, he saved our whole network.
And by the way, at this point, they're friends.
But like her and him are like, what, buddy?
They already had a montage where everything came together exactly.
The Dodgers half Ah, her and the doctor and half her enjoy butler having that kind of fun time, right?
Yeah.
I mean, they've made each other orgasm in front of a child.
Yeah.
Yeah, Child was involved.
But also it's like she's dating this dude.
And she credited Salt to Gerard Butler because I guess the other thing, too, is Gerard Butler's, like you are like a controlling person.
You have to have things such a way.
They the Cyrano de Bergerac ing is him being like, you just call chill out a bit?
Yeah, And also he, like, introduces the concept of nagging She, like, next the hell out of this guy, and it drives him up the wall, but likes it, likes her even more due to the neg ing.
And it was all because of Gerard Butler.
You know, being a pickup artist or whatever, You're totally mystery or whatever.
That dude's Yes, yes, from the VH one's or whatever s.
So they go to l.
A on.
Then she shows up there and he's like, What are you doing?

The interview problem.
They somehow get the pleasure panties on Craig Ferguson his balls, they're going on, and he's never taken him off since you know who.
Well, hold on.
Wait, I'm not getting the little joke.
Well, fuck this.
Yeah, man.
He kind of got screwed.
And he was when he was waiting in the wings at four o'clock in the morning until fucking letter been retired.
This is weird, though.
Where did this come up?
Someone was mentioning this about Craig Ferguson.
He's actually one of the smartest dudes ever.
Because apparently the contract, you get a contract That said if he didn't get Letterman's job, they had to pay him $40,000,000.
So fucking what?
So it's totally fine.
I'm not complaining, but he did kind of get screwed by CBS, but he's smart enough to know that he was gonna get screwed.
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.
You know, having a Scotsman on that main stage.
But this is what s so there is kind of a funny thing here where she's like, All right, I'm gonna be Craig Ferguson.
We're gonna do like a test interview and she tries to do much like we're trying to do a Scottish accent to its Gerard Butler applies.
Okay, Mr Irish.
Craig Ferguson?
Yeah, it was pretty funny.
S o he goes on Ferguson.
And it's kind of funny against their like friends.
I r l you can hear like Gerard Butler being so jealous of the fact that, uh, Craig Ferguson can use his real voice because, like, if you thought that this accent was struggling, you know, keep itself in the basement before hearing another dude get, maybe get like a lion, trying to behave next to another lion like they're ready to go at it.
The other lines Just eating that fuckin steak and then, like Gerard Butler lines is going to stand there and watch Craig Ferguson Lion, eat this meat.
It's like me going to a Yankee game.
Dude is really tough.
The Bronx shit in check.
It's true.
Did you like aware wolf when you go to a Yankee game?
But now I'm just imagining the switching careers a little bit.
Gerard Butler is Drew Carrie's boss.

Riot style showed up here.
Whatever it fucking pleases.
You know, Mr Kerry, I've asked you several times to keep your stupid, scrawny friends go to the office and me.

He was interviewing musicians and he knew what he was fucking talking about because he hosted TRL.
No, it it would be right.
That's why he's a music guy, man.
He knows his TRL.
Yeah, OK, little request, like Well, Eric, actually, I've made a lot of money.

So that Kevin Connolly date like he believes hard here he gets like, Oh, no, I'm gonna get the bottled water.
And she's like wait, but, you know, it's, like, kind of there's no difference, because restaurants have to filter have tap water, so it's kind of the same thing.

Ball this dude's brains out just to see what it's like because you look you're in this relationship anyway.
Like Girard Butler's a fucking asshole.
Eight Ways from Sunday.
See what it's like before you break up with I'll give.
I'll give it one day, just like that orthopedic surgeon.
You saw his dick.
You were apparently impressed with it.
Actually see that fucking gun fire that just reminded me.
By the way, there is something.
There's some conversation they have.
I think it's when they're going to Craig Ferguson, and he's like he makes some prediction about, by the way I put all my money on.
He's lacking in the package department.
She doesn't respond by the way.
I've definitely seen Is Dick like she makes no mention of that, She's like, Oh, will you shut up about that?
I would be like no, right there.
Do you feel like No, I fucking saw it the night we met.
And it's huge.
Exactly true.
Trunk s o.
Then she like she and this dude Colin like, kind of have it out because he's trying to be romantic and she comes clean and is like, Look, you were just a stupid bet on the vague terms of something I said with my co workers.
It was just like, Oh, you're you're in love with the mic version of me, right?
Spiked up version.
The weirdest part of this entire movie is that she wears extensions for half of it, which makes no sense and the way that, like she reveals that she's like, by the way, like this, how much of a liar I am and she takes these extensions out as if she's taking off a mask and scrape on.
He's just like, Whoa, I think it's It's like an inch and 1/2 extension.
It makes literally no difference in her hair cut her appears whatsoever.
So dumb.
And this guy's like Floridis like I don't even know you and they ever bring that up like Mike doesn't she doesn't know yet.
Has to shut.
It's got to be longer.
So that was it.
Yeah, men need something to hold on to me.
Oh, May what?
Do we see her get it?
No, no, that's That's the thing is, it's so inconsequential you wouldn't know they were there.
We didn't see her get it.
At the end of the film, we'll get there.
Eso come to find out.
She goes back to to Sacramento, come to find out Mike has accepted an offer from another local affiliate in the area, so he's staying in Sacramento, but he's leaving the network again.
This is all just like a weird overnight thing, but were introduced to his new show, Morning Madness with Mike.
Yeah, oh man.
And it's just with Mike and the funny thing, the bike, the gag is he goes to the his producer is like a chubby dude.
A Steve said egg type One might say that he's just like, you know what the best thing about Jean Man is?
Everything What?
I don't wanna fuck year toe.
I think the guy's like, Well, thank goodness for that, sir.
Yeah, Just should be like, I don't want to work with you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because you don't want a mother.
You're bringing it up.
What?
This sexual talk we're having already have lawsuit city fans, but and then she like I couldn't find another mike.
He's a dime a dozen, right?
She wants up earlier in the movie.
It's a dais, Ex balloon festival, or I'm sorry.
It's check.
It's check his balloon festival because, like, oh, you know, in a couple weeks ago, that balloon festival the sea of men are full of hot air.
It's such a good idea.
Both shows go to it.
Dude, you're clamoring for the fucking balloon show ratings, man.
Are you kidding?
She sweeps certain number and she gets, like, some knock off mike.
And this is dude that keeps on like, I guess he lacks the charm Yeah.
Says what Mike would say, but it sounds evil.
He gives advocating openly for date rape was just also junket, Mike Kind of.
Yeah, pretty close.
But this dude's like this.
This Jack Magnum's like, Yeah, coming to you live, Jack Magnum.
I've had sex with over 163 women, and most of them were conscious.
Yeah, to this movie's credit, everyone is apart.
Yeah.
The people in the control room are like, Oh, dude, Jill, she's Katherine.
I was freaking out.
Gerard Butler had over 200.
This we're would loser.
This dude playing Jack Magnum?
Looks like Jim Breuer was a redhead.
You see, this guy?
Negative side is that Jack Magnum is needed by rabid raccoons.
That doesn't happen sadly, Um, and Mike is there and, like the guys, look, it's your old show that they have you on their right.
So she, uh she fires Magnum immediately.
And like, there's nobody there.
And look, what do we cut to?
And they keep showing because they're barely characters Christine Hines and, uh, Cheryl, Cheryl Hines and gentle and Jonathan Higgins at the desk.
Like waiting to do something like right.
Well, we gotta keep rolling this fucking balloon festival, I guess.
Dude, it's the Sacramento Balloon Festival.
It's the biggest event of the year.
Yeah, you can't cut away, Dude, you just got to keep you.
Gotta keep it on for the rating.
It's the first thing.
It's the first time in 30 broadcasts where they aren't fucking on live airs.
And I just want to look at them now.
What's your big old Carson?
Heikal grabs the mic and she's like, Well, you know what men are scum.
And that Reich, whatever his name is, he's a piece of shit, too.
She's going through this whole diatribe.
What's hilarious is when she starts doing this that come back to the control room and Nick Searcy and all these other like dudes that are producing the show Or like what is she doing?
Yeah, and it's like, Well, the same thing as Gerard Butler are just a women's version, and also she's attractive enough to be on television, You know what I mean?
It's not like what drug butler dude face for Mad Dog.
Gerard Butler shows up.
It is.
They actually let me tell you he's still is the mic like we're doing a backstage interview in a pro wrestling event and much like the end of Police Academy three, I believe Citizens on patrol.
In this way, citizens on patrol is four.
Is it?
Which one is which one ends with the hot air balloons?
I believe it's three.
Or maybe it's for my before it's right there, right into the mail bag.
If you know if you watched all the police academy movies, man, I'm trying to think of all those titles right there.
They're citizens on patrol.
It's one.
No, it is.
It is Police Academy for where they make the arrest.
Like mid air through the end of Police Academy for witches.
Indeed, Citizens on Patrol, which also has a very young David Spade, is three.
Were they introduced Bob?
Yes, that's Bob.
Catholic School is gonna be three Bobcats kid way.
But so this movie ends it in an air balloon thing because the air balloon goes off like an air balloon guy and they're still loved up.
And I guess there's a footage of it.
There's a campus camera, you know, in the saloon.
It's attached to the balloon is the idea.
And then Nick Searcy again from the control was like, Oh, no, they don't know.
The camera's still rolling.
You're the producer.
Just cut away.
Cut.
Cut the studio Good.
It's too good rerun material.
Whenever there's Mike on this screen, you gotta keep on it and whatever.
Mike's not there.
Everyone's asking, Where's Mike?
And my And this is when they're having their he almost.
By the way, Michael most jumps out.
Yeah, it almost killed himself in a situation on like they kind of come to terms, right?
He's like, Oh, you only wanted to fuck that, Dr.
Even though whatever the you know what in like, blah, blah, blah.
They're going back and forth and though he puts fingers up but he does call him.
But boy, it's important.
Sucking were It's weird.
His anal stuff, the guys like Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Are we in a grade school right now?
This sequence in a lot of sequences in this movie remind me of the fake romantic comedy and burn after reading.
Yeah, I remember them.
Well, I don't remember anything about the movie except with the fire.
It fucks, um, sounds right to me.
I remember George Clooney builds a fuck seat.
And I hated that movie.
I remember enjoying that movie.
I feel like the Coen brothers.
It's hard for them to make a movie that we're going out right.
I gotta re watch that movie.
I feel I feel like I owe it another spin.
I really like Albert Cruelties.
Probably Lope.
That's another one.
Where everybody, What are you doing here?
People should on the Lady Killers to which is not their greatest.
But I feel like it's kind of funny.
I'm okay with it.
I remember liking that movie.
That's one I don't I don't want to go back to wanna keep that an Amber like, Oh, I like that movie moved on from it.
Yeah, that's fair.
Yeah, they're in this hot air balloon.
He's sort of like accidentally let slip that he loves her and wait a second.
You love me and he's like, Yeah, and she goes like, Why do you love me?
He's like, honestly, I don't know.
And they keep cutting back to, like all the people that are barely in this movie, including his sister and the kid music.
Wow, you really leave.
It's a question.
Is his career over now that now that I found love Oh, right.
Well, we don't really?
No, Because we don't get a, like, six months later, which I was shocked.
And instead we get a fucking sex scene that we end on this.
We got to see Gerard Butler pumping Catherine.
Hi, girl.
Well, you don't see that you do you humping.
You see them?
You do under a blanket.
You see, suits definitely do.
It's Gaudio and they all have orgasms, and then we fade in, gets off of duty.
I just watch this this afternoon.
I saw her house, some going up and down on her.
No, that was just you were accidentally flicking the input on your fucking television to the pornography.
You know, I guarantee this happened.
What fucking cut?
Did you want one or not?
Of the leg?
See, it's in the movie.
I remember being somewhat raunchier than it needed to be.
Yes, there was a legit sex scene in this.
I think you just put in images your head because you hear it do know it's there.
But right up.
Let's pull that shit.
You wanna go to dead flicks right now?
Oh, my God.
Remember tuning out immediately.
Well, what may pull it up?
Let's just say it's like because the way the dudes that they have to it's the law of a screenplay like this.
They have to have some conversation about faking it.
Probably lock.
So you hear her have this huge orgasm, but she's not even just having orgasm and get This is Catherine Hi calls movie it iss, right?
It's entirely through and through, and she's like and she has to be like, Oh, Mike, you're the king.
You are You're a god.
Yeah, And he's like, What do you faking it right?
And the last line is you'll never now right, Cut to black.
Here we go, Eric, split up.
It's it's buffering buffering.
What you got real player on over there.
Welcome back to buffering with their exes.
I can't see it is dark.
Oh, dude, that's totally humping.
Ah, wow!
Workers kept right on the edge because it's it's black.
You have to really see what's in on his hump.
Watch, watch.
It's dark, but you see his body moved.
You saw his body move up and down back, and it was It was like 11 hump It's very dark, but there is definitely the shed and see the shit.
You see that back into the lab?
I think there's a second fucker, dude.
No, but seriously like, Well, what's that guy with the umbrella doing?
Hold on.
Why, all right, Because this is what I kind of remember.
Yeah, it is a bit graphic.
I do agree.
Your light is on.
Now.
Yesterday, some of the window by the window in the book depository?
No, but seriously, there's something is happening in the Netflix office.
Went other, like someone's fucking rewind in the last three seconds of the ugly truth.
Well, they put a 12th rewind button that me.
All right, so I think we both are right.
I wouldn't call it a draw if anyone.
You know what?
Maybe we'll put up a poll on Facebook who was right?
Eric or Andrew, and we'll see what happens.
I don't need to hear your guide when we're done.
No, but like you, definitely, he's He's covered in a blanket.
He's on top of her.
He does get off of her, but I feel like there's definitely a thrust.
There's at least one thrust thrust thrust but like again, it's her movie it shouldn't like.
I don't know.
It's It's a weird ending.
Thio.
Well, it's a weird, like it's ending with, Like, she does a thing that he taught it right because she's like, because I don't remember exactly the conversations they have in earlier in the film.
But it's about like, Why would you fake, like, What's the advantage of faking a probable what he has to, like, explain it to words?
And then it's like, See, you taught me good.
Yeah, wink, End of move, any of movie.
Yeah, I agree.
It should be like, six months later, where it's like Mike being like, if the ugly truth featured it, begin girlfriend, right?
Or they have some, like, love line esque programming together something also right after that.
They you know, she's like, Oh, did you fake d'oh orgasm?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We just said we did.
Yeah.
You're busy putting the research away.
Yeah, Okay.
Watching it a few more times.
He's also hilariously like 300 esque.
Sweaty Yeah, the end of this fucking by the way.
Oh, and what it is, though, it's Oh, you'll never know.
And then she fucking jumps on top of him and turns the light off on the end table when she turns the light back off.
Boom.
That's like the end of the movie.
The lights go out on the moving and there's probably more humping.
They're both ready to go because she didn't orgasm.
She's like, I'm not kidding, But you have to let you gotta We gotta figure something out here, bed like that.
Yeah, that counts is a sexy.
I wasn't saying it wasn't a sex scene.
You said I was fucking crazy.
Well, crazy kid, you're describing it like you were watching soft core pornography.
To me, that is pornography.
Jesus Christ.
How can someone so disgusting be such a proof?
It somehow happened blissfully.
That is the end of this movie.
96 minutes to law.
My parents call me approved, by the way.
Really?
You know what?
I've been joking.
That's Ah, that's gonna but you're like that.
My mother has said that I'm repressed.
You like the head nun in doubt level.
I say, Steve saying Would you recommend this movie?
No, I wouldn't.
But I think it's not, You know, it needs something else, and it's like like populate this with comedic actors.
Usually these movies like, Yeah, you have your two sort of wood nish like romantic comedy leads.
There's other people around exactly, but there's not like you got Nate Corddry is that is, like the top of the top, maybe one and 1/2 Laham event.
Nicole Brown, who are both very funny, even like Craig Ferguson, who's a really funny guy, doesn't want a funny scene in this movie.
It should be like a funny And if you're such fucking pals, right with with Gerard Butler, do a thing like he's playing Craig Ferguson in the movie like it, but it's like a version of himself or something in there, something like a little like That's a little more appetite.
Our ask also, you know, it's just it's not.
I say no.
Oh, yeah, Don't watch this movie.
Uh, it's most of Robert.
Look at other Legally Blonde.
Most of Robert Luketic stuff is definitely episodes.
I hate this.
I draw Butler as a romantic lead.
It's not working those air weird movies when you have to have him in these roles.
Same, similarly, with P s.
I love you, which is even more of like a like a serious like dramas that ghost in that.
It's like he's dead.
But I left you all these clues.
And at the end of the treasure hunt, I say Get on with your life on lose at haunting Hillary Swank, I just realized he didn't break a single neck in this movie.
Yes, I don't like that.
I don't like that either.
They that's a deleted scene with Nate Corddry.
That's why he's not.
The rest of the fellows were killed.
You were spying on me in the bathroom.
Better break your neck.
We never see Gerard Butler's apartment.
Presumably, there's a tub with lie, but I'm not gonna recommend this because it's it's It's just a bad pairing.
It's a bad movie.
There's everything about.
It is bad.
Also, you're setting it in Sacramento, and I don't get to see Sacramento wears old Zach at Where is it?
Where is old sack do?
It's like an old Western kind of Sacramento is a pretty nice town.
My cats from their nice uh, now I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.
I'd recommend another movie where it's two People hate each other and they're tasked with spending time together.
And that's Frank Capra's It Happened one Night with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert from 1930 TCM.
Big sex Scene At the end of that dude ranch, whether it's crazy, more thrust, you could shake a stick at vibrating panties were a bit much, especially a gramophone base.
We see the light through the windows, then you can see the thrust in.
That's when you see the way it happened.
One night is a legitimate.
It is great, but it's also like it's pushing on, you know.
Soon it will be 100 years old, You know sooner than it sure won't be 100 years old.
And I will say I watched it a few years ago.
It is so fucking hysterical.
There are, like, laugh out loud comedy in that movie.
Unlike the ugly truth, I will say, by the way, stay tuned for more Gerard Butler because that fuckin third angel movies coming out there has fallen movies way.
Didn't even do London yet?
No.
Did we do an episode on London?
No, we just we only to the 1st 1 We did a little pissed.
You just watched that movie for no reason.
I wash it with you for no reason.
Yeah.
Wow.
We waste time together.
Well, maybe someday, because this one looks like it's gonna be terrible to, but this is like Morgan Freeman's now the president, Like someone tries to kill him.
That's the way this podcast is a professional waste of time.
Yes.
A cup of ah, fame.
Notorious evil.
Nobody.
What's his name there?
Don Dan.
Don Rickles.
Dom each Dan today.
No, no, no.
Fuck Jerad.
Get the play, Danny Houston!
Oh, you Cos Vapor to major existence.
Well, I guess we'll see if that's an episode.
But that is the ugly truth from 2009.
Directed like we Said by Robert Luketic Watch his movie Legally Blonde, actually so legit Good movie that he made Ah, But that is it for this.
However, it will say the summer blockbuster extravaganza, such as it is rolls on next week.
Steve, what do we talk?
Oh my God.
The world might end when it should have in 2012 would have been great to be dead by now.
So, yeah, that's gonna be the next week.
But also on patri on this month is Forrest Gump.
Oh, right, Forrest Gump.
That's just maybe a nostalgia buster for you.
Maybe a boomer buster.

That is right on for more.
We hit movies.
