thistles ahead.
Gum podcast.
This week on the program Everybody gird your bung holes.
It's the taking of Pelham 123 remake.
Um, Andrew Jupiter's Steven say that Chris Cavanaugh, Eric Cisco.
How was it?
Not Eric Bung Hole?
Well, I mean, I don't know.
That's derivative.
And we hate movies.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to the fine program as it is known as we hate movies.
By the way, um, yeah, we're talking about the taking of Pelham 123 remake directed by the late Tony Scott R i P Where should I take?
Bend over and I'll show you This is the only podcast that will use the word bum hole twice in an opening We're gonna save much more.
Yeah, yeah, This is the bung hole app Welcome back to the bung hole.
Our Listen, I'm sorry, but you have a major motion picture in where the lead actor uses the word bung hole in such a way We're gonna be talking about it all night, baby, If it's not a Beavis reference, you really have no no reason you don't have a leg to stand on your just saying bung hole.
It's It's a weird word.
But, you know, if people like saying it, that's fun.
I like the bung holes.
Walk like an Egyptian is a great tune.
Uh, Steve, that's not the right name.
What?
Uh, yes.
Oh, this is a remake of a Walter Matthau.
Move V.
Who else is in it?
Quint from Jaws.
Robert Show Jerry Stiller.
Elizondo.
Very young Elizondo.
Anybody have no direct that movie.
Chris Kamman.
Ah, well, above of a sergeant.
Yeah.
Oh, Joseph.
Sergeant, Of course.
The director of previous episode of my getting this right Jaws.
The Revenge will have a Joseph Colonel Mann.
I think that Ah, taking the one to dig a bell.
20 three's a Master p.
I just love that movie.
It just really I started film for him last year.
They did look whatever kind of a thing it was looking for New York something.
It's just a very eminent.
This movie, actually, to its credit, does evoke New York quite a bit, Tries to it does its best through the Tony Scott Lens, which is probably the problem.
It's a it's directed, I think, by a dude who didn't really give a shit about this city, which is the thing that, like you can like.
I would not qualify this as a New York movie, which, whereas the original 100% is a New York movie, is that a good movie either?
So you don't watch it?
Well, yeah, there's also that s o we kick things off.
We love, we're loving numbers.
We got Melon 123 and we're starting with Jay Z's 99 problems.
That's fantastic.
Yeah, well, this takes forever this, like, remix cut up version of this song.
I don't know what this is.
Cool.
It's contemporary is letting you know the setting is contempt doesn't just settle into any kind of rhythm.
You're just kind of listening to breaks and breaks and breaks.
It ages like a bad book, though, doesn't it?
It's just yellow and crackly.
It's really weird, like this movie like Thank God for all You Pierced out There we are keeping within the confines of the 10 year rule with this movie.
It feels so much older than 10 years old.
Watching this DVD butt out, butt out ball point output output down.
You just you could just smell the special features feature at just just hovering around the marginal Because I realized rewatching.
Hey, John, for the feature at say something funny for the DVD featurettes.
Would this funny you wouldn't something you wouldn't steal a bung hole.
Why would you steal a movie?
But open up, open up!
The legal purchase of this bung hole provided 10,000 jobs in the industry down an opponent that on our bone down, down on I know what I mean.
If you don't know what we're referencing, I'm sorry, but what were they thinking with those commercials?
I gotta say the spy game might be the ultimate DVD.
It's like a movie that I don't think it exists on Blue Ray or you kids stream it.
It only could be Watch me a DVD.
I liked that movie, You know, It's only good.
One time I saw it.
Still never seen it.
I need to get it.
So you have todo Dude, it's a total fucking dad movie.
Those air right up your alley.
You dad move.
You might be seeing one Blue Ray copies of it, but actually, that's the devil's own in there.
The But this is actually a dad action movie to your point a little bit.
It definitely is.
I don't even know Dad.
It's a dad.
Afternoon, er, kind of thing.
Can I tell you the perfect the exact perfect time to watch this movie Four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon?
Yeah, that's exactly when you can watch his movie because it is so low octane, but I guess still qualifies.
Maura's an action movie than it does.
Ah, heist movie, I would say Never.
Time to watch.
This is absolutely never but so we could.
It's done and problems we do open on.
Travolta is the first person you see.
Yep.
And this movie, this movie posits that the toughest, most scary person you can ever encounter in the New York City subway is the edge from you to it.
Just like that.
That's what this look is and like it looks.
It's supposed to be so fucking bad if the edges turning into killer croc like very slowly but it was getting there.
He's just sort of like strutting down the street in this movie.
Yes, he's got a skull cap on.
Yeah, this horrendous handlebar mustache, dude, he's auditioning for the village.
People would just say it's not good It's so so not good, but he gets fined.
Audition to the village.
That's what I get that out of the way he gets on in Times Square.
I guess he takes the S train today to the east side.
It makes note the it's 42nd he gets on Lexington, which is, you know, on the other side of town.
By the way, the s train imagining we were somebody high CS train and no one notices Strange today.
Really?
I did.
Yeah.
It's hot enough, I guess.
Yeah, getting from Grand Central to Times Square.
But I thought this was, like, the seven train platform.
Okay, so maybe takes the 7/7 more of useful train.
Well, that's an actual train.
One's a train And the other one it's s for shuttle.
I just think other way.
Oh, my God.
Yes.
Train's gone under.
Oh, I got someone hijacked the s train.
I knew this day would come.
Holy shit, He wants $10,000.
My shuttle is gone.
If you hijack a train that has literally to stop three.
You got a brand park.
You gotta Bryant Park Square show.
We're talking The Times Square shuttle launches Times Square to grants and and back again, said Chris.
Captain is correct.
You can on Lee, as from a maximum of $10,000 each one of them is worth their 50 bucks.
You, TOMs have to demand that the New York City Transit Authority pays off your sort of large credit card debt, and you'll be surprised the shuttle does get crowded.
Doesn't look.
It's super crowded, man.
It just I'm anti shuttled the time it takes to get down there to swipe your card.
Now why?
I know just what?
Because you're walking towards Times Square in Midtown.
It's just so many people.
How did you deal with people?
What are you talking about?
That's the best part.
I am usually pro walk, but I was running a little late.
I got a couple of trained guys at my face, right?
Unless Train Guy, I'm with Steve on this.
The shuttle that's by TVs trade.
You keep calling it the S train.
Nobody calls it that.
I do the Times Square shuttle, and it's convenient.
His balls.
Do you think it stands for shit?
She betrayed the people.
Take a walk down to 44.
It's a little more walking you want in a 41st.
Then you cut across and you get, like, so less people.
Come on.
I don't know, man.
Just that whole area is a nightmare.
I just cannot.
And I only go down there maybe like, once a month for a screening.
Or like if we go see some some theater, but it's like goo, It just makes my fucking skin crawl.
I should say, by the way, we should have mentioned this before.
That whole quote unquote s train riff a riff.
This is gonna be, well, tangent diversion, alternate route would have said a classic riff.
I think that one of our best.
Well, see, the thing is, I had to take it today because I had to be somewhere by, like, 12.
15 was like, 12.
And, like, I'm not walking there in time.
I'm just gonna point alittle it's going to be a very New York heavy episode.
There's nothing we can do about.
It s so he gets on and like, it's the original.
Everybody's point has Hector Elizondo is the number to this.
We have Luis Guzman who's great, but he has nothing to do in this movie.
At least Hector Lozano has like a thing in that movie.
They had two Croatians.
I don't know what he wants.
What Air gun on characters.
They might as well not even be in this movie.
They pulled him off the fucking seven.
Taken one.
Like, Who are these guys I would get from Apulia?
You've got John tratar Oh, and James Gandolfini in this movie.
Make them the whole crew.
It's Travolta, Tetsuro Guzman and I think the feeling that we're thinking, Yeah, but as much as I like you think and Steve and I d'oh, that's way too many heavy hitters.
And that means that whatever is going on on those fucking train cars, it's getting way too bloated because then everybody's gonna have tohave a thing because Gandolfini would be on the way to blood also, like if someone shot it and me just, you know, just like walk it.
I bet that he's a he's a larger man.
Yes, I got you there.
Waas.
Well, he was.
He's been dead for like, five years or whatever.
Quite some time tragically watching this movie, this piece of shit movie.
I think he's still good in it.
And I was.
I was getting furious with the universe, watching this, playing like Mike Bloomberg, I guess pretty much, yeah, a rich guy, that mayor.
But he is.
I got to tell you of why I love Gandolfini in his movie.
He's so against his type.
Which is Tony Soprano.
Sure, uh, like he's such a fucking once in this movie and everybody's taken a dump on him and tell him to go fuck himself and publicly humiliating him at every turn.
I love it, and it's another flip because Bloomberg is a tiny daddy and a big old big daddy.
A Bloomberg ever found that turtle shell here.
He'd be enormous.
That's true because he's also doing the whole, like Bloomberg was always very big gun.
Yes, I take the subway to work every morning.
Yes, of course, I do think that Blasio still like mentioned that here and there.
But Bloomberg was like, Yes, I am a billionaire, but yes, I do take the train every morning.
I traveled there on my golden subway car, built especially for my birthday.
Whenever they see that, it's got to be like a special car that no one ever see?
Oh, yeah.
Spit shine every day, just zooms through every station going 150 miles an hour.
It's a train car, but really a teleportation.
Nobody.
No.
Yeah, I gotta tell her.
It's shaped like a train car, but when you get in, it's just a transporter.
Bloomberg's money?
I'm not saying it could be double tracks.
Mr.
Mayor, where we're going, you don't need tracks.
What?
I never saw that movie s so then this is happening at the same time, we're introduced to Denzel Washington wearing Ah, fabulous dads only sweater vest, this fucking thing that they got him in.
And he's supposed to be, I guess, a little pudgy here in this role is really a jelly donut.
Yeah, yeah, really?
I didn't notice.
That's part of it.
He's just like wherever lived in when it was just like a working stiff who's not a police officer but pretends to be one at the end of the movie coming up against the greatest of all the schlubs, Walter Matthau.
Yeah, like give a certain not to.
And I think that's what, like, he spills coffee on himself, but also they also nod to him by naming him.
Walter is virtually.
It was Walter, right?
And, well, garb is switched the names of his last name.
His last name is guard.
They're both Garber.
Yes, but he gave his name all the math.
Outplayed garbage.
Okay, Yes.
I didn't notice that, Steve.
So thank you for pointing that they mentioned his way to He says he's like to 20 on a good day.
And there's a little African Oh, right, yeah.
He doesn't start drinking at 9 a.m.
And this is also during Denzel's trained phase because right a year after this, he did unstoppable.
Also by 20 Scott.
Oh my God, Everyone's on the trade Just got on the train train That movie is also bad, but it's better than this.
I never saw it.
Correct That movie Tony Scott wanted to make I want to train to go all fucking apeshit crazy like and even throws it into this movie for no reason.
Like but then, like, stops it.
Yeah, very some ceremoniously thing.
This is supposed to be like that seventies movie that's more of a potboiler in the seventies.
Movie does go to the end, right?
So it's kind of marrying that a little bit, but they do.
They do try to make it pretty extreme.
Tony Scott was really fighting under siege to Oh, fucking definitely.
Dude, how about that Better movie s?
Oh, yeah, Denzel, also kind of like getting shit on in this movie.
Yeah, it's kind of funny.
He spills the coffee, the whole this.
It's a massive control room.
This whole room turns to laugh at this man who spilled coffee all over himself that I would be too scared to laugh it.
Denzel Washington, I've been because he's terrified is a really cool, tense guy.
You can't not you Look at that guy.
I don't think he's also supposed to be a bigwig in the company of I guess the MT eh?
Yeah.
He's currently eating shit right now.
Yeah, but it's like still, I mean people that each it could be on top again.
You don't want to get on their bad.
That's true.
Yeah, it's true.
Yeah, you're right.
And they've all seen him angry.
I mean, if, like, during some, like, walk out or something and he's just like there's a bunch of backed up drains.
You've definitely seen him flip his lid, and you've all know that he can go there if he needs to.
Death is mad.
He was my question about this control room because the New York City Transit Authority, like the MT.
A.
It's a piece of shit or suspicious science fiction.
The Bridge of the Enterprise.
Right.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm looking at this room.
Like what?
Are you kidding me with this fucking rial one?
There's, like two rats on a wheel running around.
Well, I also love at one point.
It's early on the Sir, sir, the the the Pelham.
123 The line is our is stopped.
And it was what, like that.
That would be like, Hey, Tommy, the trade stopped again, but every cent funky.
And let's see, it's a Tuesday.
Yep, that checks out.
It's a day of the week.
The train stopped for no reason.
The concept of it just being like, Oh, this is the name for one individual train.
I guess it exists.
I mean, you don't want to hear 123 in the subway aboutthe 123 line prices on the Lexington line 456 It's very gets gets to Pelham or leaves Pelham it 1 20 three.
Well, Pam's okay, that's how really There should be one Colin 23.
Yeah, that would make sense.
It also, Pelham Bay is where the six train this is.
The titular train of this film is the one that I passed out on a wound up, waking up.
And I fell asleep before Pelham Bay.
I was asleep at Pelham Bay And then when all the way back the living this movie a little bit there is that movie of that train going crazy?
There must have been there.
Must have been apparently, like some controlling like Sorry, there's someone sleeping on the Pelham 123 line.
Oh, my goodness, People, people just sweep around him.
Exactly.
Eso this like Heister.
Whatever starts at precisely 2 p.m.
I think move.
Everybody's synchronizing watches.
Travolta runs up to the front of the train.
And if I can pulls a gun on somebody, I'm gonna fucking pull your brains out.
If you don't, he is.
I mean, here's the thing that the cast is good.
You don't even you've got You've got Denzel.
You've got Gandolfini.
You've got to Tora.
You've got even Michael Rispoli is pretty good, you know.
You mean like Michael Rispoli is not bad in this movie?
That's of course, Jackie a prio from The Sopranos, which is weird when he and Gandolfini in the same room in the third act of this movie that was freaking me And Guzman, you know, is it good?
Is known to be a good actor and Travolta Travolta can be good, but you give him a fucking ham sandwich, man four crazy isn't Travolta.
Show no one else matters knows you've got, like, John Tutterow trying to, like, look tense like Oh, my God!
This fucking train situation.
And then you got Travolta on the other in the London Your Grace.
Paul Grace?
Yes, you grease ball.
I don't get why he has turned up to 15 and 1/2 in this one.
I think I know why.
Because Robert Shaw is that, like a simmering to that whole Here's a mercenary soldiers taking over this This train he, like, has the training and the temperament to do this.
This guy's just some monster.
Even when he makes out with the 3rd 3rd rail at the end.
Oh, yeah, you have that after like he's at two.
There's nothing going on.
So all Travolta can think to do is go the other end of the spectrum.
Go to nine community.
How am I going to make it different?
Yeah, exactly the opposite.
Hello.
I'm John Travolta.
I live with my parents, the but no, but I don't think it's that Christian ethics.
This is just the John Travolta villain standard.
I'm going to be over the top.
Now, here's the question.
Because this human face off, it's him and fucking swordfish.
Swordfish is what I was gonna ask you.
Is he higher above the bar in Swordfish or in this move, this move is yours.
The zord fishes better move it better.
You know what, Dylan?
I think watching that fucking dick sucking made a mellow out and swordfish, right?
Who?
All right, whatever.
Halle Berry's blowing Hugh Jackman in that movie.
Guy's cracking.
The code is not blowing him.
No, no, no, no.
She's just in the movie.
Oh, she she does full frontal nudity.
Top topless.
Excuse me.
Just topless.
This movie, though again.
The other thing that I hate about that what they change from the Robert Shaw character would you set?
Yeah, he's like a trained mercenary ball blood.
Travolta is like a fucking white collar crime money douchebag who run, Who's He's the only white collar criminal in history to do hard time.
Yes, in a jail where he comes out with fucking neck tapped.
And this is what this movie tries to tell you, like Hey, man, if we her if we actually put these like white collar Wall Street criminals in prison, they're just coming out of supervillains.
Eso you just can't do it.
You just can't do that.
We've got to keep him out of jail, Man them all.
The Jeffrey Epstein's You don't want that to be a super villain.
You got to keep that guy out of jail too late, man.
Seriously, my let's work.
It's what Alex Acosta was trying.
I think we should make him talk, touch the third rail, touch it with his fucking dick Levy.
Cool.
What's that?
Yeah, it's and it's, you know, it's it's just Garber.
He's going through his daily thing and then, like, Oh my God, something's wrong with the train and he calls in.
And this is the Tet A.
Tet begins with him and Travolta, which, and somehow shockingly, that first movie in the 19 seventies makes two people talking on a fucking radio.
Intense and exciting.
Yes, Not here, friend.
Well, because again, they're giving two different energies and, like, none of it makes sense.
And like, I think if you had, like, somebody on the other end of Denzel Washington's line, like actually giving it right, you know, you could give it.
Give it right back to fucking Travolta.
Denis Leary, Could you imagine?
Like, Denis Leary playing like a coked up fucking maniac, I guess.
Screaming back, Adam, Who would you cast look weird Dream casting this bad really cast Gary Buse.
Oh, maybe she's all right.
Welcome to dream casting.
We'll also will be Dennis LaRue be smoking in the command center.
Yeah, President.
He doesn't smoke with this fucking edge haircut.
He takes his hat off eventually.
And you realize this was the end of the Travolta natural hair because it's like it's kind of gone at this point, you know, buzz short.
But you know what?
It signified.
It's dignified.
It's tough.
That's the thing I was because I was like, I know when we talk about Travolta's hair in this movie, and I have to defend it.
It's fine.
It's totally fucking fun.
John Travolta.
You just You have the front balding going.
Sure it's what it is.
Do they look like a fucking clown in the rest of us?
It made me realize he could be potentially a good Frankenstein's months.
Uh, right.
That's not what somebody wants.
The here.
Great role.
Look at that haircut you have.
You could play a fucking fine monster thing about him with some bolts in his neck walking around here so I could tell you that he would react poorly to that.
I can't believe I haven't thought about this in a really long time.
One time when I was a kid, my uncle got a bad haircut.
It was bad.
It was like someone like took a bowl.
But it was like a lot like a motorcycle helmet.
They just cut all the hair that was hanging outside of motors.
Like I was out with him and my aunt.
We're going somewhere.
They brought me back at the end of the day, brought me back home.
My parents were at the door.
We walk inside, they come in to say hi.
My mother sees my uncle and goes, Oh, did you get a haircut?
He says yes.
She immediately not a fucking second of space.
In between the sentences goes You look like Charles Manson, dude.
Holy shit.
That's he didn't let that go for, like, 20 years ago.
So did he, like, get a bunch of female followers?
They're living in the hills.
All right, You know what?
If that's what you think that you think give me a tattoo of a fucking swastika between my eyes.
I guess we're doing.
Listen, the reaction to it, the reaction was something close.
Do I'm going to lean into it.
If that's the way you feel.
It was a massive dust up, But like, don't tell someone you look like Charles Manson, Did he?
Lets you, like, hold the baby after they cut out.
Anyway, I'm just saying Travolta's hair.
It would be fine if he was in other movies.
Cease laughing Of Sharon Tate.
That is pretty hilarious, but, uh, he would be a great Frankenstein.
You know, this was like, 10 years ago.
Now, I don't know what it worked.
My bonhomme mom, um bongo are like 2019 John Travolta.
Maybe the Mummy.
But you're seeing all these movies where he's like that fucking brace boat guy kills this fucking movie he's in.
It's just out.
It's one of these the hilarious categorization of ah, still in theaters.
Hey, we can't find fucking anybody to book this in theaters where it's him and Morgan Freeman.
And like, they're assassins or something.
Oh, the something, rose.
Yeah, And it's again.
He's just got this fucking asshole Wigan.
No, I mean, that's him in that moose movie.
That s move first directed.
Oh, now called the fan a matter that was the fan.
But then I realized it's the fanatic.
I guess I got to see them.
It's coming Thio Amazon Prime sometimes.
And this nun that actually something went wrong with that.
It was a different movie.
Screwed up all.
The call was a fly in the transporter trying to send it to Netflix.
And now it's a monster.
It was the wrong what, like they had screwed up the title.
It wasn't 2019 the fanatic.
Some other year what I love, though.
Okay, if that's true, that's fucking hilarious, because that means Fred Durst has no idea what's going on with his own movie because I saw someone on Twitter like Retweet him being like, Yeah, that's right, baby, it's coming out of it.
Come on.
I actually no.
I just thought of a new pot boiler like in 1970 way Need Maur potboiler Marijuana in Water.
No, it's you work.
It's a guy.
It's a woman who works to the Web.
Slaughter ranks better, and she's, uh, she's trying to work in an entertainment website, and she's got up until noon to find out what's going to be streaming in the next month.
I got to get the numbers I got, like shift, like go through all these back channels to find out what's going to be Street West.
Sounds boring.
Well, that's why I have a question.
What are the consequences?
Does they relish the daily lease, Jack actual rank?
Or that is Jack Nicholson's Air boss like, Hey, you better get those names for me by by noon around like a bunch of chili on the floor.
Pick it up.
Old dick elicited.
So it's already but 50,000,000 not least this.
I mean, you can't handle the stream with you know what but what you're describing, and it's fine.
Sure you're describing a play that's adapted into a movie?
Yeah, it's It's low stakes, which is appropriate for the theater but doesn't usually work so well in movies in this context.
But maybe, like some, there's a manila envelope, but it says Netflix on it.
What is it?
What's it here?
Your whole thing is like it's like a Web site being like, What's leaving Netflix this month at the fucking blood sweat tears.
That's what that is.
The film.
That's what it turns out.
You think it's just something you could look up?
No, no, no.
You've got to find that information.
And I'll tell you what, dude, she's banging some dude who claims to have, like Intel on.
It's like your boyfriend.
Then it turns out he's been crooked the whole time cooking how in this No right.
Taking to take the street rights of Frasier from Netflix to Lulu, and it's a huge fuck.
It scared that this guy's doing a What's he wrapped up with this reporter for for sex, by the way Reporter.
Okay, so this is a reporter.
She's an intrepid reporter.
He's like right?
She in her article.
It's like Fraser's leaving that flix and he's just like you.
Now that I had such good sex with her.
She's asleep satisfied, if you know what I mean.
He goes over to her computer and like a race is the Frasier from from the article, that's exactly like nails it to the editor because he's got, like, somehow, money on it.
Like the stock's gonna go up like their stock options involve.
This is a fucking it goes all the way to the top, Erica.
Oh, then you're getting closer.
Keep digging.
Fraser is leaving Netflix, dude and measure on Netflix, but oh, absolutely Fuck.
I gotta dig in.
Dude, we just started Season 11 of Cheers and right after that's done, dude, we're heading over to Frasier Town.
And then how about this?
The end is like there's a call for you.
Like she saves the day somehow, right?
Frasier?
Frasier remains wherever Frasier was supposed to go like there's a call for you and she's She has to leave the celebratory party that the office gave for, So she walks into her office, her new office.
She gets a new office puts a piece of cake down on the table.
Picks up the phone, like half laughing at somebody.
Sure.
Hi.
What is this?
Oh, thank you So much for saving.
Freij is streaming right, and it's a Kelsey Grammer full.
You film him out streaming rights where it absolutely is.
Actually, it's just people just print stuff, and it's like, definitely Well, I guess we're looking out at the end of the month.
Yeah.
Listen, I'd watch it.
Question is, where would you watch it?
I don't think they let something scandalous that this Go on.
Netflix.
That's true.
Is made this fucking YouTube red.
You're not wrong.
That could go to crackle.
Frasier is going to you to bread.
Oh, shit.
We need to stop it.
Oh, man.
I've always been curious about that cobra Kai.
Siri?
Uh, curious enough, I guess.
No.
Yeah.
I mean, I've been kind of curious to men, but not here is enough.
And I have CBS all access.
Nice.
Yeah, that's how not curious I have about you to bread.
And the movie is called coming.
Coming to streaming this January, and it's incredibly confusing.
You're like, Wait, what is this?
The article is the movie?
What?
What am I doing?
This is savvy marketing.
I think this idea sucks.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, boy or your your face be red, dude win so that I can sell this great ideas, and it's it's better be be original if you use anything that I said in this, I get a piece.
It's a voodoo money.
Yes, but this is better.
This idea is better than the taking of Pelham 123 parentheses.
2000.
That's true.
So John Travolta murders this transit cop because it's one of these, like, Oh, you don't fucking believe me.
Uh, the guy just starts nosing his way in.
Right?
Right, Right.
And actually what?
Oh, this guy?
Because he's like trains.
If you see this guy like following them for a little bit, like sniffing out something, and then it's like what?
Whoa!
Oh, trains it.
Police And this fucking it's not It's not Travolta.
It's one of these Eurotrash dudes just murders this guy's fucking stunt man, man.
Just give me somebody.
Anybody, but he gets a murder, and then Oh, shit, they separate.
The rest of the train goes back.
So it's just the one car, which is like the original.
Yeah, they do that.
Yeah.
I feel like there's more hostages in this movie than in the original.
Um, it's about that.
No, this is the same.
But they actually go to the length of, like, let's really delineate thes character.
I could do it in this movie.
Mom, Mom's scared child.
Black guy.
Uh, dude watching a fucking strip tease on his laptop.
Somehow we're gonna talk to this guy talking about this guy.
Yeah, I think it would be on the phone, but yeah, this is fucking ridiculous, because there's no way you can actually stream content on a laptop in the New York City subway.
No way.
Not now.
Not now.
Not now, not 10 years ago.
Like they have transit WiFi now.
And it's a fucking joke.
Well, Martin Martin Sheen is texting Leonardo DiCaprio in the Departed on the fucking Boston train's Gotta follow the money.
No, that's not happening.
Definitely a fucking dad.
Motorola Foot flown, dude, he's getting what he sees that it is drafts at the end of the movie where he gets it three times.
An hour later, he's been dead for a while.
This is crazy, but yes, he thought this dude, this kid is like in his early twenties, is on his laptop.
Burning is fucked.
Propped up on his boner.
That's a horny.
And he's like, he's extreme chatting with his girlfriend.
What I thought was across the country was actually just didn't like Brooklyn or something like that.
Yeah, even weirder.
It does look like text or call, but your video?
Because I think, dude, I think the deal is like, Hey, like, it's it started with a text, right?
You should come over.
I don't know.
I'm playing PS three right now, you know, You know, you should really come over, open your laptop, and then he sees the little striptease that's going on.
Right?
So then it's like, Ooh, like, click this link log in disguise.
Okay?
Dude, Dude, Dude, Dude, it's 2000.
Okay, now there is.
I don't I don't get it.
It says it's connected, but it's not connected.
Hold on, baby.
It gotta update my flash.
And I think that's why he runs out the house because he doesn't know what's going on.
And it gets on the magnificent transit WiFi where his real player starts kicking in.
You just touched the pole and it lights up and everything works.
And she's like, Oh, baby, I'm so Indian.
She's like, flashing him and stuff yet.
No nudity here.
But I guess somebody probably Tony Scott was like, Well, where's the TIA in this movie?
Well, it's on a fucking trains, but it's about a bunch of grody ass men in a fucking subway way.
Had to take it out because you said bungle, like, 15 times.
We're not so bung holes.
You could have had some unity somewhere, and it would have found you has something Exactly 13% of the dialogue is motherfucker.
Yes, motherfucker is throughout this movie, which is weird, which it's That's a bad screenplay, Travolta.
A period on the end of the sentence is motherfucker.
Yeah.
Yep, talking aboutthe.
But I think what he's doing, it's an interesting motherfucker Pronunciation because he's the mother part.
Motherfuckers were pretty like the other.
He's yakking the mother.
Yeah, I get it.
The mother is mother.
Oh, yeah, but the fucker is fucker.
So he's doing motherfucker.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Yeah, the fucker.
Yeah.
Just if the A is on one the A's on the other one.
We have the phone, motherfucker.
Oh, yes, yeah, that's true.
Dialogue from our movie.
Moose Travolta in it.
Yeah, yeah, listen, that we're getting very seriously, dangerously close to the point where John Travolta will do your movie.
He's like he's like the head of the competing online publication that also doing an article.
Dark cast dot gov.
What streaming?
There's one of those websites that's like that.
It's like it's not that, but it's like who's stream?
And where you know there's every every month at the beginning, the month.
What's leaving Netflix?
What's coming in?
And flicks.
It's big.
It's a big school.
Apparently, it's a giant industry.
Indiewire does this all the time and you know what?
Who gives a fuck?
I've written several.
Oh, dude is a likely I'm talking on a second.
We just got the life rights of Christian.
It's definitely credit will definitely be based on a column written by its Justus Harrowing.
As you think you would think so.
I'm Ella Killing Ansel Elgort is Chris Cabin.
I like this.
Wait a minute.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
Well, we said on the poster Ansel Elgort is in this movie who just came under sentence.
Fucking Alden Aaron, right?
Huh?
No, No, you don't.
Alden is the dude that sleeping with him.
Oh, now he's working for the other side, like Travolta at the other website.
And he's the one that's back is easy is the one that's the leading Frasier from this from the Chris cabin article.
Now I understand.
Like if something's coming too sure, but like the whole, like, better watch it now.
Fuck you.
I don't have enough time to watch the shit I'm gonna watch.
You don't at all.
If I want to watch something, I'll just look up where it's streaming.
Yeah, just let it die quietly, like I don't need to know what's leaving.
Doesn't have time to fucking watch it in two days.
Anyway, you didn't care before.
You won't care that they're just trying to give everyone foam.
Oh, right.
You heard.
That's what kids were saying.
These foam Oh, dude, have fear of missing out.
Oh, yeah.
My dog's got that really bad.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, go in the other room.
Dog wants to go outside.
No, you'd be like out.
I don't want to piss on the floor?
No, Like you go into the kitchen, she'll follow us and what's going on.
And I don't want to miss anything that's going on here.
Nothing.
I'm getting a beer.
I'm sure she also Mrs not pissing somewhere.
Yeah.
Dogs love watching Frasier because there's a dog act.
That's true.
Oh, big time.
Just very soothing dogs.
Read the most of these online webs.
Yes, s o the police show up to Grand Central to, like, get down into the tunnel because there's reports of gunfire and stuff going off.
One of my favorite shots in this movie is right here.
It's an overhead shot of Grand Central.
Nice, really great looking shot of the area.
All these cops pull up.
You see, they all come to a screeching halt, except for one cop car that just slams into another one.
Like accidentally.
Well, that's the thing that they try to make.
This movie is basically what?
Ah, yeah.
He ah Travolta ask for $10,000,000 the ideas.
You have 60 minutes to get there.
I'm gonna kill one passenger for every minute it goes past, right?
So there was Oh, my God, we have to rush the money there and that happened to the original.
But, like maybe there's one little accident in this one.
There's like 40.
It's nuts.
You're like hitting people with cars, motorcycles, air flying everywhere he ask stores.
I think it's It's It's $526,000.
300 man, I can't read numbers thing I've noticed about me.
Is that right?
Disgusting.
It's It's 500 God damn it.
I'll put it on the curriculum along with the biology.
I wrote it down.
Wait.
Gotta burn your school district to the ground.
Dude, they did you no favors my brain.
Chris, read that number you published Author.
I circled it.
$526,315.79 right multiplied by the passengers.
$525,600.
And that is the dollar amount.
Every passengers were.
It turns into 10,000,000 and one cent when they do the math and he tells Denzel that he could keep the one sent as a broker's feet.
Brian bung holes in motherfucker and fuck use and fuck your father's talking about stains.
The Gandel Feeney getting humiliated in every scene he does appear in with a smile.
$525,600.
That's the dollar amount, every pass and Jews worth It's kind of beautiful.
It's not.
It's not too shabby this get on the soundtrack to our network.
Wait, Maybe it's a musical.
Oh, yeah, totally was streaming streaming along with Rogers and Hammer farts over here.
Uh uh.
This is around.
So Travolta is on the horn with Denzel, and he's like, you have brokers for you can keep the one cent.
I want the $10,000,000.
But it is one place where the o, uh and this is the great line where Travolta says, Get off the radio and notify the man the fucking yeah, it's just like, okay.
And like, 10 cells are trying to have a nice movie in.
John Travolta keeps ruining it Kind of.
He calls him the Girth, the Gerber baby at one point, because the last name's Garber is close enough.
Cool Gerber baby boy like you, that's the other undercurrent is like whatever he's like flirting with him the whole time.
Wants the fuck you want.
Munchen's sex in prison.
Yeah, how he would make Denzel his bitch has got a sexy voice.
Yes, I think Travolta is one of those fucking dudes that's way too into phone sex way, way too into phone sex like it's the only kind of sexy has his phone.
Second has to all be yelling.
Not one under.
Ah, large decibel doesn't I?
Probably depends on the like.
Certain phones are probably better for phone sex.
You want that long cord gives you something a little like play with right.
Or maybe hands free, though.
Yeah.
You want all the I guess.
I don't know.
I just remember that.
Remember some phones when they had their super long cord.
Oh, yeah, the longer the better, right?
Because then you go to all sorts of different areas of your living last.
So around your genitalia with get up and dance while I'm never calling you on the phone.
Had a speaker funds got two hands to play with.
The way you do whatever you want.
Think you want the accessories, Erica, whatever you want.
I could bring the accessories there.
That's just voice sex guys, it's not really a phone.
So we cut to a different six train in Gandolfini's on this When he's coming from the Bronx, it appears funny enough.
And there's a 9 11 joke where you have to go to this place and read a children's book, which is a kind of referencing.
He's talking about his like the schedule for the day.
But this assist this.
Another assistant comes.
They stop some where the door is open and the rest of the detail like, I guess they're just like, following him.
It's this part in the Bronx where, like the Six train is above ground.
So they're like driving underneath it or whatever, and these dudes run up.
And this guy this, like the number two would ever gets on the train and just yells, Somebody just hijacked the six train, which there are.
Yeah, yeah, it's not like he the mayor has a private car.
There are, like public citizens all over the place, and this guy comes in screaming.
Gandolfini's like, uh, would you please quiet it down?
Yeah, not so loud.
And then somebody, he's like, Oh, we got to get there right away.
We'll skip all this.
This train is making express stops.
No, no, it's that it's that big expressed.
They all start freaking out like, Oh, I got to get the work over.
What I love this movie is like, Okay, now you are piggish New Yorker Number seven, your piggish New Yorker cop, your piggish New Yorker firefighter.
We get into triple digits.
It's big, biggest New Yorker 105 They're all like, Oh, go.
Every last one of these extras are like somebody with, like, one or two lines.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're just gonna come.
Spiderman's in trouble.
Don't express Spiderman's in trouble All of you better What?
One of us?
You mess with all of us.
Good.
That shuttle those pigs up, they think Spider Man Israel.
There's also weird thing around here.
They're back on the horn with Denzel and Travolta and someone asks, Or is this where you know the talk?
And Denzel is Somebody has something about terrorism.
If they do, I sound like a terrorist.
Kind of doesn't do I terrorize you, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I get that Joe Pesci for a second.
Yes, definitely.
There's a lot of him doing bad job because she's supposed to be from Jersey, and that's what he says, Yeah, both it is.
That's cool.
That explains, he also mentions that he hates sitting inside like the motor men's room of the train, because he feels like he's in a confessional.
Yes, eso them, like Denzel is like taking notes, just like from Jersey Catholic question.
Oh, yeah.
God, this sucks.
It sucks, dude.
So this is where Tetsuro comes in, trying his best to save this fuckin sinking ship movie?
Yeah, he's, like, kind of doing his night of character a little bit, except for the weird feet thing.
I was just going to say, Thank God, it's, you know, to see new fucking foot cream in this movie.
You know, I bring it back.
No way.
Spice this up a little bit.
Spice it up A.
Sure you're not spicing up with foot cream, buddy.
It's foot never spiced up anything.
I've never tried foot cream.
It's hot dogs that you might be.
Maybe there's a little spice to, uh, but yeah, so like, he's just like he's the hostage negotiator.
He tells All right, I'll be taking this over, Denzel, right?
And you could leave the movie and his boy, you just you hang back and his boss, Michael exposing.
Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
Take a take a hike and leave the movie.
All right?
You take the day off so he leaves and travels.
I would have talked to Garber, but the fucker he said to call him fucking calls tripled greaseball.
But our detour a greaseball because this thing is Italian, but so is Travolta.
But not this character, I guess.
I guess not.
Because his name is Ryder with a Y I and I guess this would be a fake name.
It's a fake name.
We learned his real name later in the John Gifford or some nonsense Totoro Is Detective Cama Nettie?
Those?
So that's that's what that's given Travolta carte blanche to fucking whip out greaseball.
I always just think it was a huge mistake that he wasn't Luigi And that marry on the Mario Brothers tear.
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
It's easy one.
Absolutely.
I think.
Wouldn't you watched Johndroe jump?
He does that little like leg thing.
Yeah.
You ever see Gianpietro do that?
His knees are amazing.
I've seen go down a pipe.
I'll tell you what, man.
This fucking Jesus movie that just like announced It's coming and not Jesus Christ.
The sequel to the big about the sequel that Jesus Rolls is now what it's called these because going places because was inspired by a French film.
Yeah, the Gerard Depardieu movie.
But so this is what I mean.
This distributor is No.
One.
Of course, like this.
Nobody wants no one's asking for this.
Nobody even likes the movies you actually have directed already.
John Tratar Oh, I'm gonna get them.
If I gave the term my script about the coming February, they go for it.
Maybe he probably doesn't know enough about Streaming.
So you?
Probably actually.
What if his character from Rounders was in it that you're going to finish?
Dude, everybody's asking for Joe Commission's own movie, That suit a sequel.
The Rounders Screamers.
Yes, it's called streamers and we're done.
Yep, that's right.
Now you gotta cut Eric.
Now you've got some points, Thank you.
And then, like, well, streamers, isn't it also like it's a Robert Altman movie?
Yeah, but like, it's like something kids run around with streamers.
Yeah, so you have that on the poster with like about TV, not working and Frasier as well.
Yeah, something tells me that no matter which way you slice that this movie is getting a bad posed.
So, yeah, I mean, he s So he's gonna do Garber.
They're trying to get Garber, and in the time limit, they don't get it.
So he winds up shooting this motor man, this part of my heart, the relationship that Denzel has that his motormen changes in, like, 10 minutes like they realize it's Jerry.
Whoever the fuck is the motormen who was driving this train?
Come on.
Denzel is like Jerry, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I think I went to motormen school with the jerry blah, blah, blah.
And I'm like, Okay, that's fine.
And then, like this dude, Jerry gets murdered and Travolta comes back in.
Our Denzel comes back in, and there's some dialogue back and forth.
And then Denzel, I think only because Jerry's dead has the audacity to say Jerry was my friend of yours.
Wasn't your fucking friend.
You haven't spoken to Jerry and years, you liar.
Well, he's just cause he's dead.
Now.
He's your fucking best friend.
He's got the heat down his neck.
Yeah, because they think he's fucking got paid off by right.
And this is a weird thing.
Like, apparently he got paid off by a Japanese company like he was gonna pick this Japanese car like trains.
All right.
Car?
Yeah.
To be in the New York City subway, which is also fucking rich.
The idea that anybody from the M T A.
Is outsourcing new trains for our subway line.
And Seena Mol Dokey trades that are in this movie are still the trains now definitely selected one.
And then the Japanese, we're like, Here's $35,000 is a bribe on top of that, Like he ski claims he had already would have selected that one anyway.
Right?
But he took the money.
Supposedly.
No, he definitely Yes.
He says he also used it to pay off his kid's college loans, and he was a tuition demoted because it's like it's like the investigation is going on.
What happens?
Ongoing.
Travolta has a gun to somebody's head because he's like I didn't know up dealing with motherfucker did just take that money.
And no, I didn't take it.
Take the fucking money.
I would have fucking get there.
Yeah, he's gonna kill fucking strip show streamer on and then he dishes on the whole situation.
But it's a weird parallel with the original film, because Walter Matthau is like saddled with these people that work at the Japanese subways system that are taken for around.
I'm stuck touring around all these Japanese, and that's that that's that.
That's where it ends like that's the extent of the Japanese.
Stop taking pictures.
That's the joke, though.
You know, it's like the fact that Japanese oh great!
Now Japanese people air here.
That's a joke in 19 Come on, dummies.
They don't understand English, the monkeys and likes to fuck.
And then he they're like, Good bye.
It was nice.
Seeing your facilities, like, was a righteous way.
We have to talk about because around here when I got Robert Shaw calling me saying something about a bung hold liqueur wet What?
Who is this?
Think this guy really wants to fuck his mother?
I'll find that bung hole.
I'll kill that bungalow for you.
Let me talk to Bloom.
Put blue back on the phone.
He at least wasn't speaking of whatever bung holders are dark bungles like a devil's button dolls, but no Oh, those bung holes in the cold ocean water is Christ Jerry Store.
Did you hear that?
He said, Bung hole again Great Jerry Stiller in that first movie Show me the way to go home.
I'm tired and I want my bung hole Went to sleep Well, had another drink about now ago, and it's gone right to my bung hole chili drink, dude, really drink.
Oh, stupid.
What I was gonna say 10 minutes ago was what you see in this movie, and this is just like textbook Tony Scott when the tension is really rising.
We have this bullshit like it's not slow motion.
It's like stutter frame shit.
Boy, does this not work?
It's that.
And it's not like, you know, in the first movie, I believe it's the middle of the summer.
I'm not one of your classic sweating my balls off here, speaking a bung holes in my reaction.
I'm not sure about there like they were thinking of Die hard with events, of course, but I mean, it's it's, you know, a lot of long tracking shot 70 this the fucking cameras like spinning around.
Yeah, I was getting nauseous Yeah, you know, literally that is once I think that's the first scene with like, uh, would get if it gets off the train is like spinning around his head for some reason for yeah, for no reason.
What keeps cutting like You can't stay on the shot for like more than a second.
This is like it's Tony Scott like this is like a latter day Tony.
Scotty doesn't know what he's doing any more trash.
It's just thinks it's on commercial.
Another angle, another angle, another angle, another angle.
It just it doesn't like.
I hate movies that are edited like music videos.
It's Michael Bay's the same thing like I just cannot Let's slow it down.
Let's fucking look at something that you've got great actors.
I guarantee you, Denzel Washington isn't blowing a take.
You know, exactly.
Need a lot of coverage with Denzel Washington s.
So there's a bunch of cops that are comin up the tunnel like approaching from like a safe enough vantage point or whatever.
This is where we're explained.
Ah, that $10,000,000 is the legal limit that James Gandolfini, as the American just request from the New York Reserve or whatever.
And they could just issue it like without much delay or something like that.
So that starts getting Gandolfini thinking about like, Oh, that's weird.
Even I didn't know that.
Like, how does this person know that that's a little too much of a Quinn Quinn Ki dink kind of a thing, but his whole back story doesn't matter like it is.
His backyard does matter at the end when, like he embezzled all this extra money.
But that doesn't mean anything to the audience.
You know what I mean?
Like it is an ad.
Travolta.
You mean?
Yes, it doesn't add any more weight to the character or anything.
No, because he's just a fucking scumbag Wall Street guy who went to jail and he's fucking you know that his knickers in a knot about it.
Also, something in this movie that I feel like is a drop thread, and maybe it's I hallucinated it, but it's so that's possible.
It seems like Travolta was trying to game the market as well because, like he's like, Oh, look at the The stock's going down because of the Dillon cares if someone have 10 people are taken hostage who gives us.
That's what's weird, but you have.
The $10,000,000 is a decoy for this larger scheme that Travolta's running on buying gold wallets low.
He embezzled $307,000,000 at the end of the film.
Yeah, look, he looks up his laptop again.
He's like, years where I'm like, this is how we're like thistles.
How your economy works, everyone that this is what it's all based on fucking bullshit numbers and manipulation.
0 10 people in New York were held hostage.
The price of gold is going through, I guess.
Well, better odds.
Better take all your money out of the bank.
So what was taken hostage downtown thing doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.
I don't understand that either.
I mean, the stock market in general is this bullshit.
That's that we don't have, wouldn't have pensions anywhere we have you, you'll play the market.
I'm not playing shit.
I got a mattress and there's fucking money under s.
Oh, this is so.
It's weird, though, because before any of the Denzel took that bribe shit really comes up to Touro is like, instantly suspicious of him.
And he's like, weird.
So Ah, you've always worked this desk.
Did you ask to get this desk?
Why is this guy wanting to talk to you?
Do you mind if we send people to search your house?
Like which is the weirdest part?
Like, Yes, I do, Honey.
Hide the weed, honey.
Had the wheat honey the way.
I mean, I'm just saying NYPD if that was fucking Michael Rispoli in Denzel's position and Denzel was somewhere else in the office, man, someone's house isn't getting searched.
That's all I'm saying.
Do.
The end of this movie is science fiction of Jude.
I thought I was on another fucking plan.
I thought I was watching the Twilight Zone way.
We will get there, but yeah.
Yeah.
This is like, Hey, uh, do you mind if we've all I could get a court order to search your house?
Or you could voluntarily let me?
You'd get a court order that you could do?
Yep.
Am I being detained?
Question number one.
Am I under arrest?
Question number two.
I would hold the whole Jerry thing over this dude's head for way longer.
Sure.
Just be like, Oh, you know what I'd love to, but you remember how you fucked up that whole thing with Jerry.
And you told me to go home.
Guess I'll just go home again.
Oh, you want to search my house?
Guess I'll just go home to my house.
You know, Jerry, he was He was the godfather to my daughter.
You know, that was when we were close.
Minutes later.
Jerry was my brother in law.
Hey, does he does call?
His wife was, like, 29 years old.
I don't know who this woman is.
I don't know.
I do not.
Second wife scenario, that is, is fucking oldest daughter.
Like someone's home from college, answering the Delvaux.
He must be living with her and she said, The only woman in the movie, period, That's it.
Pretty much.
Yep.
And, uh look, well, don't forget Cam girl.
Oh, that's so I apologize, Cam.
Girls got some fucking dumb is dog shit.
Stuff coming up later in this world is basically he's like, hey, but he keeps the camera on this kid because he got fucking unlimited WiFi in the empty A and he's like, Oh, babe, keep stream and call the news organization.
Well, it's a weird thing.
Where like he gets shoved or something in the laptop falls under the bench.
Yeah, and he doesn't notice it right away.
But he's also got some, like, Bluetooth earpiece.
Which Kim, I just don't think that this is happening in a subway.
Don.
Oh, not today.
That's today.
Also been.
Could you take your top off again?
I'm going to go out.
I want to go out the best way possible.
Actually, you know what, babe?
I can't see you right now because I'm being held hostage.
But I wanna have a boner.
So could you just like we'd miss a penthouse forum?
Just I wantto have a boner.
Yeah, I just I'm in this situation, Right, honey?
Honey, do you know what?
SMR Could you open a piccolo ultra for me?
Quick, quick, quick, Tear open some mail.
Don't know.
Slower.
You when Travolta is doing the whole thing about admitting to the bribe and whatnot in Travolta's Got the Gun and Cam kids phase here.
Travolta has another weird line here.
Was like, Yeah, he's got an 80 skateboarder.
Look, he's making it work.
Yeah, just Will you please stop being so viciously horny?
Everyone's already in this movie.
There are times to be horny and there are times did not be horny, such as subway terrorism.
Yep.
Uh, so this is around the time when all this money is plowing through New York that we we kind of get a little bit of the two guys driving it and like the's Buckethead, a different car accidents that delay this thing again.
And the 1st 1 was one.
The cars, they're flipping it.
There's like, This is what happens when you can't take the six training.
There is a wild moment where they blow through an intersection and I think the move is they say something about like we've cleared all the streets.
All the lights are green, like you can go dipped in a he fuck this dude driving this cop car.
It's like the fucking blues brothers.
There is.
It's I don't know what.
I don't remember what it is.
It's not a school bus.
If I think it's just like, Oh, I think it's a cab.
Yeah, they plow into this taxi, the taxi goes flying and the cop cars got like a weird like it's not a cow catcher, but there's like a thing on the front of it and they blow through this car.
They tear it to ribbons and keep going.
And I'm like, Well, that dude's dead.
You said this 16 isn't running.
Reminds you of that.
It's a trailer that I've had to see all summer, and I'm sure that's gonna be the dumbest movie of the year.
That Chadwick Boseman movie that's coming out.
What are you talking about?
Anyone Bridges bridges where?
Like 6 21 you might forget might be 21 bridges.
Six cops get killed and, like Cheddar, opposes the lead detective in 21 Jeff Bridges.
Bring him to justice.
Should I'd watch that dio multi verse of Jeff Bridges remake Multiplicity with Jeff Bridges.
Definitely.
Taylor Kitsch is in it, but the new What is the movie called Constant?
You got Taylor kitsch.
First, we didn't get the fucking name of the movie, I believe with 21 Bridges.
The biggest story, one that I think it's 12 Horsemen.
That movie with Michael Shannon with the horses, the horse soldiers of something or other strong 21 Ridge is it?
Took me fucking four second.
Okay, 21 bridges.
But what happens in eight or 10 cops get killed in some sort of a sting operation.
It's a big deal and chatted.
Bozeman's investigating.
Is it like, uh, if these guys who killed these cops get off the island, we're never gonna We're never gonna catch them.
We need to close New York City so they close off the bridges in New York.
It's crazy and stupid.
It looks like a lot of a dad fun.
Wow.
Well, look at this.
Cast J.
K.
Simmons, Sienna Miller Taylor Kitsch.
What about the tunnels, dude?
Chadwick Boseman.
Key tunnels were closed.
You dude, no one's getting off.
The way we worry this is tunnel or a shirt where the tunnels in this title, how it's put on bridges and 17 2121 being t dude, dude, that's what she could.
Belle B and T.
It's the same plot.
But then also, they just keep cutting the scumbags going, the Ranger games.
And for some reason, the Staten Island ferry is still operating.
They won't try to go in there, keep that boat going.
They're not gonna go.
Thing will eat him alive.
But it looks really dumb movie, so yeah, whatever.
Um they?
They're the running up the deadline The deadline is about to happen.
And because John Travolta is so in love with Denzel Washington, like, you have to give me the money.
Now you have to come here and do it right.
But before we get there, can we talk about the ass model?
Oh, we need to talk about the the Icelandic as or the lewd Vic.
Lewd Vika or something.
The Lithuanian ass model.
I took tow.
Iceland.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What about it?
I was just reading the rest of my notes and it said asshole of the dog.
And I'm like, I don't know if that's from the movie.
It is okay.
Travolta's telling some story.
Oh, yes.
That was the story about last year.
Always looking at a dog's ass hole.
Oh, you got the lead, dog.
You're always looking at the next dog, asshole.
Right?
And it helped him in prison because he got shit all over him from this dog when he was on a dog sled in Iceland.
And it was like that dog could shit anywhere he needs to shit.
I could shoot anywhere I need to shit.
So that way, when he went the dog present.
Dude, that's another movie I would watch.
John Travolta.
Dog President John Travolta stars in pound puppies This'll summer prison is going to the dogs.
The warden I tell you, if John Travolta went to a kill shelter, 30 days would pass and everything.
Well, I don't know God, he wasn't very good.
No, ironically, pit bull would come and get him.
Oh, that makes it.
Then they'd make some fucking director streaming movie together that nobody would say, but this'll asshole line.
And this the Lithuanian ass model like everyone's charmed by his story like Denzel, the other people in this control Oh, give him the money, which I guess is sort of what that's supposed to be right is like humanizing him.
But it's like it's just that guy that bragging about lead, Easy's Bay.
You're talking about how you fucking flew this woman from JFK to Iceland on a whim?
Yeah, this is like six hours from JFK.
Okay, Well, like, let's go through the flight histories.
Ludovica.
Yeah, exactly.
A Lithuanian national going to Iceland.
I mean, we should be able to find Well, that is how they find out who Travolta.
Really?
Okay, Stop watching it.
Sounds like you did.
It says that you should think this is not a movie.
Five defense.
It really falls apart.
Like basically, I mean falls apart from the get go.
But at this point, Denzel has to go.
Actually, we should say, Luis Guzman gets shot in the head.
This'd is so fucking stupid.
Uh, well, they find out who he is first.
Okay, that's Phil.
Motherfucking Ram.
Oh, somebody says, Yeah, he's like he's another fucking disgraced empty A employees, though, which is hilarious.
Who winds up killing, getting who wants it?
Who killed some people on the track by accident.
He was drunk.
He was drunk driving a train and nailed some people on a platform somehow, Yeah.
I don't know how.
I don't know anyone that seems like it's their fault.
Yeah, why?
The only did two years.
It's manslaughter there.
And he did some time and he met Travolta in the clink.
And that's how he's part of this scam.
But also, here's the thing about Louise Guzman Nan.
He's known for being like a great little like motor mouth character.
He's got, like, six lines.
This says nothing is so dull.
Notable his only thinking.
Oh, man, I think I'm gonna die today.
And he's like, Well, if you keep visualized, you will.
And that's it.
And then he gets shot in the head because this fucking snipers got a gun trained on him and he gets bit by a rat and he fires the gun off.
This is social.
Also, Travolta thought he got a good line.
Let's get him out of here.
And Guzman is doing a thing.
Am I remembering the original correctly?
Someone in the original, Is it Martin Balsam has the thing on his nose of awesome is the one who has the cold, right?
Yeah, but this lowest same.
Okay, that's what are Luis Guzman?
Is this a motor man that has its the inside job angle?
And he makes it throughout the entire film.
And he's the pivotal thing at the end of the fourth guy.
I'm almost positive.
Is Wilson from Home Improvement?
Oh, wow.
Oh, you run behind that fence and giving everybody folksy wisdom in that movie.
Yeah, Earl Hindman, you're totally right, Router.
In this, it's fucking Luis Guzman who's dead and two fucking stuntman.
Whoever's I mean, it doesn't have to be like an All Star cast, but no so confined to other people in 2009 you could be those characters.
By the way, Earl Hindman left this earth in 2003.
Wilson is dead.
Tim Allen is still running around.
Robert Shaw is named Bernard Rider in.
Yeah, but they also do like Mr Blue.
Mr Green.
Mr.
Grey, Mr Brown.
Which is pretty fun.
It is fun.
That's where that's where they got it from.
For the Wizard Wars.
I think that's where City on Fire got it from the Quentin Tarantino double stole it.
Cold double stealing.
I didn't steal it for you, Jan.
It's much better than Jack in.
I don't like when they jack images.
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Ideas, man.
I double Jack.
So then there's so the weird thing, and this is I think, I think, to Taro's character needs to be put on some sort of suspension after for sure this bungle because, well, first, all this sniper shoots him and causes huge dust up.
Another passenger gets killed here like the guy who is in the Air Force of Black.
I guess that's what that's what I'm getting into.
So his second bad piece of advice, he's like, All right, So listen, the time is clearly going to run out.
You just have to keep talking to him.
A Ziff the time didn't run out.
As if Travolta, on the other end, isn't paying attention to the time music.
Just talk through the deadline and Denzel is like, Okay, but then the fucking deadline happens.
And of course, then Travolta's like Welp.
It's 3 13 PM Hold on, hold on through 13.
Let me pitch you a movie about streaming right?
So he's like, Wait, hold out!
What?
And then they go on for 20 minutes.
What is streaming 3 49?
Frasier is going to what were Once I do another, you're gonna put ah whole television siris on a thing and you can watch it whenever I think you'd be great to try to explain streaming to some way would be, Yeah.
I mean, from the P D company, exactly where the foetus features go.
He just loves common.
What about the bloopers, motherfucker?
Me?
A motherfucking featurette now knows.
Let's hear about that dog's asshole from Frasier.
S o Moose was the name of the actor dog actor Kean A sp r t Moose just died recently.
Joey did.
Oh, wait.
In my thinking of a different dead, I don't get the buggy from, uh oh.
Did he pass away?
Christ, they're all go all the way out of the Eddie Saw 9 11 my friend.
And I think you know any definitely saw a 9 11 Fraser last 2004.
They swap that dog that there are several Eddie's.
This is why we need, like, a dog.
Really a dead dog movie database.
But like in the memorial, the memoriam at the fucking Oscars, you're right.
Drugs on.
But it doesn't have to be all the like stunt dogs.
But like a dog that has played out, we'll see the 50 from a dog's purpose.
The big dog Dead dog.
I am DP And it's like played by bingo.
Dead 2004 by I think I think it's great for all pets like doom.
All get the parents and their parents.
Jimmy the raven has an imdb page.
Why is this so hard?
What about the fucking pad for Paulie?
What about that?
Oh, that fucking bird is still alive I built.
How about the fucking Bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons?
I think that was the duty played predator who is dead.
What about all down the question here.
If we're going all out, Do all of the Roaches from Joe's apartment gets credits?
Or why Now those were popping computers and puppets talk off light.
I want a living, breathing animals that you there are some actual Cochran thinks I do it.
Then definitely.
I think there should be at least one to represented.
And the I hopefully they have named be named and catalogue, or at least like numbers are letters.
And were they any of the same cockroaches from that X Files episode like I want to know like we were?
You know, I think it starts with, like with the critter Wranglers, like those I am.
Yeah, those guys that supply all the crazy.
I'm sure they're busting their bugs from movie the movie.
I'm just saying insect movie database maybe should be a different website over San Juan.
Okay, people.
And that's right, people about worms that's going to get, really, I think worms be on there because people have pet worms have.
Listen, I'll say that I guarantee you there's no paperwork on those worms you wouldn't be able to trace.
What about all the centipedes from Indiana Jones?
The double A doom All those guys got to be.
Oh, yeah, but, you know, they could be like a group.
Okay.
Like like a like a performance troupe.
All those stunts, spiders from Iraq.
In a phobia, huh, Toto?
And you don't like it?
Just don't go to their page.
Stick to your dog pages, but I'll be over on the fucking thing.
I'm looking for fucking Eddie.
That boost the dog, mongrel.
The fuckin said to Pete.
Well, listen, they're not I feel like they're not being named like that.
I think they're being named like like great number 482 kid like it's like it's like a centipede, a centipede, And there's gonna be a drop down menu near the search and Okay, you got it.
There's gonna be section just include dog in your search.
Or I think the move would be to just look up talk and Mommy, look up the movie, you know?
Oh, yes.
Exactly.
Like the movie page comes up and there's no actors.
It's just the animals.
You know that t To be fair, I do want the torrential A from the original home alone featured heavily.
Oh, yeah, that was great.
That was a pivotal character Buzz in there, too.
Half of the Lon Chaney's relatives could go in there.
A featured interview with the butterfly from midsummer.
Yes.
Yes.
So, anyway, all this to say, talking through the deadline doesn't work.
Travolta decides he's gonna kill the mother.
Yes.
This dude who has discussed previously in the film with the mother she notices led his army Rangers rang is she's like, Hey, let's fucking rush these guys.
Terrible idea, you idiot on.
He's like, Why are you looking at me to do that?
And she's like, Oh, I saw your ring.
He's like, That was a long time ago when you've got a whole Punisher movie that you know, you get to watch.
Yeah, So this dude stands up to defend this woman.
Travolta fucking blows this guy away.
Sure.
And like so, like, at the end of it, basically, Travolta's like, you've got to come down here garbage.
You're the only one I trust, man.
All right, So he liked takes all this money.
He's got a fucking like crane or something.
He rides it up there.
One of the guys.
What?
The cops gives him a gun?
Bad idea.
This is just a fucking private citizen.
Um, and the ideas, he's just, like dropping Ma.
Drop all of the money off, but no.
Ah, he actually brings him on the train because he needs someone to drive the train right now that, uh, Luis Guzman is dead.
Now we have to mention, though the fucking worst idea for a phone call ever is right when he's leaving to get set down on the train tracks, they're like flying him in the helicopter somewhere.
And Denzel is like trying to get on the helicopter.
And he calls his wife real quick, and he's like, Yes, so spoiler alert.
I am the guy on the other end of the radio talking this terrorist.
She's like, Yep, I kind of figured and he lays out like, what he has to do.
And then he starts talking about, uh, like, giving their daughter track and field advice for a meat that's coming up because he's clearly planning on dying.
This isn't a thing to say to your wife before you're about to do this.
Just say, Hey, get the icy hot ready.
I'm gonna have a bad one.
Yeah, it is like make sure that Denise runs through all the hurdles, just like we talked about.
What you do is you always have to give right a long, intricate and involve letter.
Put it in an envelope and give it to Michael Caine.
In case you don't need it.
He will decide whether or not to burn it.
Really.
But I will deliver it felt you know exactly what it says.
That the streaming rates for free wait, Hold on in this envelope on the streaming rights to Fraser, it's a passcode.
The 11 Seasons of Frasier.
It's a secret Netflix channel.
It's a streaming right.
It's all that's left of you.
He looks over the Cafe de Ces.
Frasier was it just wasn't just his hallucination.
Who knows?
I've already buried Cheers.
Not going to bury another spin off.
Joey was Tortelli is a dead Joey was too much.
Uh oh.
And the other dumb thing in this helicopter ride that we got a point that this is another fucking stupid I really feel like if 9 11 hadn't happened, this line isn't in the movie at all There dryer, The writing in the helicopter do Douro is looking at the skyline and he says something about like, Oh, it's really great.
Like seeing it from this vantage point or something, he goes, you can see what you're fighting for.
A fucking flush that line, please.
It's the spider Man line, man.
You mess with one of us.
Think this is a round Also where they said the team at the Mt A, like realizes that the cam thing is going on?
Yeah, because it makes the local news right.
The news is now watching this strip camp.
And what is the way?
It's revealed, though, Like the scene starts with the girlfriend being like I love you.
Yeah, and he's like, Yeah, that's great.
I'm in a fucking hostage situation.
She's like, Ah, it would have taken you less time to say you love me back then what?
You just and she's like fucking yelling?
Yes, And what doesn't make any sense right here is one of these fucking Lou Gosh motherfuckers comes up, Sees that the cameras, they're just goes like stupid kid and like, kicks the laptop because it's like blinking like the battery's low.
You gotta kill this guy.
Well, I mean, that's the thing.
Comes to nothing.
It's a It's a thread that does nothing for the movie just to show you that you could scream on a fucking Vaio computer.
Yeah, they even get footage of Ryder.
And it's not like he's identified from it.
Yeah, nothing really coming.
No, no, they die.
I vetted by Phil Ramos.
That's how they get.
That's how they see Rameau's.
I think it's either that or the sniper's camera.
What, you're sure it's him because Ramos doesn't leave the fucking control.
Really?
I think the snipers get him on a camera separate.
Okay, um, because they see after like they then also see that the murder, the accidental shooting, how it really comes to nothing ever know, really does nothing for the movie.
And Travolta tells them in the command center, like All right, you know, you need to call me when, like Denzel is down on the tracks like making his way there, and this is another link to Touro calls him, and he's like, Oh, I'm detective.
Whatever.
You know, we spoke earlier and he goes, Oh, yeah.
You're the greaseball.
Would you go out for a pizza?
Yeah, Well, then you can you don't tell me where he is.
I'm gonna fuck you with the ass grease ball.
It's like white.
I think that just said he was gonna fuck me.
The thing that it's just a bizarre choice, but yes.
So they have also.
Yes.
So they tell Denzel that one of these bags has a false bottom.
That's where the gun is.
Uh, this is fucking, uh, names a rider.
He turns out to be Dennis Ford, nine years in prison for white collar, something something.
And yeah, this is This is this exposition trained falls like an avalanche.
It's like, This is where he's they find out he's manipulating the market.
The movie's over.
It's a relevant like I do.
I do remember the best Travolta line.
An actual funny joke is when Phil Ramos, his dad, he's been shot in the head.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And Travolta says that he was the brains of the operation.
Yeah, it's like that's a That's a line that joker would have.
It's not too bad Travolta would have loved to put.
Could you imagine John Travolta and Fat Joker?
I would be into it.
Jack Nicholson already fucking like that is it was the original fat joker.
You're right.
I just rewatch that the other day.
He's pretty.
He's a little tag, Dad.
Joker Joker with two sees that.
You see, by the way, how Todd Phillips is already trying to get ahead of the nerd outrage, it's it's just gonna happen.
Says it's not connected to the comic.
Yeah, he was like, This is a movie about Has someone like the Joker would be made or something like that?
He's trying to dodge it now, which I don't care.
I mean, that's fine.
I'm like the fucking maniacs out there that they're gonna blow this Joker heads out there, dude in those T shirts, tattoos.
My God, Tattoos, right?
You think I got a tattoo of ah, John Travolta in pitting Capello 123?
Yes.
Yes, and there's a little cartoon bubble.
It says, Look, my bung hole motherfucker, that would actually be pretty cool and actually accidentally says, Look, my bung hole, Mom, it's on stupid tattoos, Ducky.
I definitely think there's a rash around it without a doubt s.
Oh, yes.
So they get Travolta or rather, get Washington on the train with all the bags of money, and they have him drive it.
They get to a point where because it's on one train like they're going downtown.
The six train.
But Travolta wants to go to Coney Island.
They have to do attract change or something.
So they're doing that.
They jump off.
It's a whole, like misdirection.
A real thing.
By the way, the Roosevelt Tunnel.
Yes, really thing right here.
Secret New York thing.
Ah, tunnel under the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, the President Roosevelt used to use to get an announced nobody stars disability one.
Not so, he says, like direct me to the Roosevelt Tunnel.
And it's a weird, like Denzel like they really take advantage of, like having this character work for the M D.
A.
Because he's like Take me to the Roosevelt Tunnel and Denzel looks to the left, looks to the right and then is like, Yeah, it's that way.
Come on, you're just in this tunnel.
But then he just basically goes, Hey, look over there and runs away because another train is coming, crosses their path so he has a chance to escape.
And everyone put your hands together because that should be the end of Denzel Washington in this movie.
Absolutely.
Because at the end, Matthaeus of the original like he's just sort of investigating after the fact.
He's not like trying to take anyone down.
That's what the cops are for, right?
Like he's just sort of like, Hey, there's some dirty motor man out there.
I want to find him and he does.
But through the sneezes, just great end of that movie.
Oh, yeah, but like Denzel was like, I've got a gun.
I've got to stop this guy.
And this is not This movie gets away completely and they just like mmm on and then turns around he doesn't like this is when uh, Travolta and his guys get to the Waldorf.
They part ways, they all have bags of money.
Great line from Travolta when they realize that Denzel is gone because, like these to Lou Gosh, guys air like freaking out and he's just like fuck it, let's go and have fucking indeed end this movie.
And, uh, this is when the two guys get murdered by Lou.
Gosh is turned into gula Oh, my God, Do these guys get fucking shot?
T?
Oh, not too bad that squib city is your classic and y p d overkill, man.
My God, yeah, just two guys with guns.
They get shredded by police that they'd just get obliterated, threaded its residents.
No, I just could say they turn into soup here told Sonny Corleone, It's the Senate Parliament.
It's part of The Simpsons in the Roger Rodney Dangerfield episode when hoping it's murdered.
But it was a computer simulation.
It's that, but it's on the computer now again, what he'd look like if he was hit by a wave of baseball's whatever.
Get Brock.
That joke is, um so yes, So then this.
The train is still going.
They haven't unlike they attach a thing around it so that the dead man switch doesn't, you know, get activated and flying towards Brooklyn.
Anything is Michael Rispoli?
Never.
He's like a stuffed shirt that needs to get his, but he never does, because he's messing with Denzel.
This entire movie.
He's messing with Denzel this entire movie, but then at the end he's like no I I guarantee you all the terrorist is still on the train.
The train is moving.
How could it not be moving right?
And like he's proven wrong, but that he would lose his job doesn't get, like, no high in the face.
So he said like, Oh, yeah, we closed.
We got people at every tunnel.
We're out except for the one super secret one that anybody who's run the actual tunnel knows about.
I forgot about to tell you about that one.
I'm sorry.
I'm stupid.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Could somebody write me out of this movie, Please?
They do.
He's just gone.
He's out of the movie, Denzel, by the way, commandeer somebody's fucking car.
Oh, guess what?
You're going to jail now?
Yeah, you're ta employ.
You can't do that.
It's like some, like painter truck or something like that.
It's some dude who's trying to just goto work, and it's just a fucking car chase in this movie for no reason.
It's chasing this cab.
He gets to the Manhattan Bridge trip.
Did you notice the fucking geographical cock up here with the filming locations?
No, because Denzel is following Travolta.
Travolta just hails a cab.
Yes, and he's clearly seen driving onto the Manhattan bound side of the Queensboro Bridge.
Okay, I fucking drove up that on ramp every day of my life for years.
Good looking out around that Tony Scott like, No, that's the right.
It's a great on RAB.
Show me on ramps today and try to find the perfect on.
Oh, definitely.
There was a meeting about that.
Absolutely.
Look, I'll even take a Cincinnati on ramp.
It looks like I wanted to look at the smokestacks doing in the back.
And so then immediately after that is when Denzel's like he's heading for the Manhattan Bridge.
And I was like, What?
And then they actually do use the Manhattan Bridge at the end of the movie and, like Travolta, is a huge traffic.
Whatever Travolta gets out of the train out of the cab because the police have, like, cordoned off the bridge now because Denzel calls 911 and says, like Hey, uh, no, Listen, I'm a guy that works for the empty A and tell them Rider, who is this?
It's like you know what's catching you.
Okay, I'm the guy who's being investigated for the bride.
Whoa!
The right of the train thing.
That ticket that's still going on.
We thought you went to jail.
Oh, hey, guys, it's the bribe guys calling 911 s o he they like they closed the bridge like 21 bridges over here.
Oh, shit world Pretending like we're not definitely going to watch that movie.
But what I wanna see it eventually seat theaters.
I don't know.
Maybe if I lose my job between now and then you do that.
You do never know.
Hey, fingers crossed.
Steve that the audience they're pitching Thio Free up.
Time for you to write the streamers.
Yeah, that's true.
That's right.
That's my retirement plan.
That's true.
My retirement grease And you Hey, could he confronts to tour a Travolta with is gone and he's like, That's It's in the line, Rider.
And like, there's a bunch of cops at the end of the other end of the bridge.
They're running towards it, and I'm sorry, but they see a black guy with a gun.
Who?
They're telling their instructing to drop this gun.
Yeah, they are they yelling?
I have their guns out there like drop your guard, drop your gun.
And Travolta's like, You gotta kill me, motherfucker.
You gotta do it.
You gotta sit.
Everybody knows we own.
We owe God great death.
And, like Washington says, no, man, you can't do it.
I'm not gonna kill you today.
I'm not gonna kill you if that I'm gonna kill you, Motherfucker.
Travolta's also like giving him this fucking spiel about how, Because he doesn't, like, say it correctly.
So like, unless you've paid attention to the rest of you don't really get it.
But he's basically saying, like because he's made Denzel kind of like the hero of the day that he's given him his life back.
So he's like, I gave you life back, You know, I gave you your life back.
And if you don't kill me right now, I'm gonna take your life back.
Look, I forced you to confess on the air on a portable device, so you owe me.
You owe me Big Daddy, and you've given me a boner all day.
So you're the one that needs to kill me.
And then in the greatest piece of science fiction Tony Scott ever directed Denzel Washington shoots John Travolta to death.
And these six police officers running over the bridge do nothing.
Well, then drop your gun, man.
Hey, Drop play.
God, still their guns drawn on him like you.
A black eye fucking opens a wallet, and he's 41 shots or whatever the fuck it that number is, it's 41 shots.
Is the Springsteen?
Yes, but I mean that.
I mean, it's it's so in solids loose cigarettes.
Like, what are we talking about here?
Movie?
Because it's not the real world.
And like, these cops finally get up there.
They're like, Ah, you killed Hey, what are you talking about?
Yes, the idea in this magic world is everyone knows what John Travolta looks like.
Everybody knows what Denzel Washington looks like.
Like they've been briefed on the situation.
Yeah.
Okay.
So which which one is it?
Which one of you looking to kill?
Which one is it?
Our Yeah, It's the one that looks like a fat The edge.
Roger that.
That's a fat The edge.
Got it.
Uh, hold on.
Is that the edge from slipping up?
No, the edges not slipped out.
The edge is in you too.
I must have been thinking of the edge of the wrestler.
Are we talking about that guy?
Long blonde hair?
Got it?
Uh, you two.
You mean the spy plane Over Now?
That's right.
There is a spy plane that has a gun drawn on a on a man on a bridge.
All right, we got a bridge of spies situation where we eyes open for a mark Rylance!
Over now!
We got a B F G on the bridge.
I heard the words of Mark Rylance on it.
You know what?
We're going to shoot the black.
It's okay.
Over and out.
Oh, man.
Zia Travolta fucking drops down.
This is another like, busted frame missing frames, jangly looking garbage as Travolta falls to the ground.
And this is Oh, this is dumb.
Travolta's final words.
This character's final words on this earth are You're my god damn hero.
What are you even talking of?
What are you talking about?
What?
Ah, like if you wanted to die, Travolta, There are so many easier ways and not bothering all these people.
And then now James Gandolfini's like you took you went to bat for New York City, and New York City's gonna go back for you.
And this city has a very good batting average and we don't know what that.
I guess that means they just They cleared, They cleared his fucking rather the bribes.
Of course it's about the bride.
Yeah, because Gandolfini Gandolfini says tomorrow New York's corrupt, you know, Fucking cool.
$35,000 a drop in the bucket.
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
It's over with everybody.
Of all of a sudden he started talking like Tony Soprano, for it is still to this day by the window, By the way, the until the big starts tomorrow.
What good to worry about it.
I have seen him in so many other things that aren't sopranos.
But every time it's unsettling to not hear him talk like Tony's Brenna.
Very strange.
He's got quite a flair for there's also a really bad because we realize we have John Deter in this movie, and we forgot to wrap up this character after the murder has happened.
Here.
The helicopter flies by the bridge, and it's too terrible fucking saluting him.
Yeah, it's like whatever, man, I'm going home.
But a CD later, Spider Man or whatever happens that fucking helicopter just took.
John did euros straight back home to Brooklyn that end of the day that was his personal helicopter shooting on set, he flew off Movie Island.
He's just gone, and at the end of the movie is Denzel Washington, returning home to his 25 year old wife.
Right.
I have this subway by the subway and he picks up a gallon of milk.
Look, she asked on, Like it's this weird freeze frame that fades to black.
It looks terrible.
Stupid.
I will say The one thing I did like about wrapping this up is when he's on the train going home.
He sees another train driving by.
And it's this, like, I don't know him being a little too generous here.
But it read to me like a nice moment of this character, like seeing the trains and you see, like he's still, like in awe of this industry.
Like he's like, Oh, I just I like trains.
Here's a train riding by kind of thing.
I read it as he clearly died in the scuffle.
This'd death dream of the trains working after, because the terrorist thing happened in the middle of you're totally right.
Happy?
Because that's the only way you remem bring that milk.
I saw that look.
I was like, I'd forget that fucking I'd also have a fucking load in my drawers because I shit my pants so I would take Mayor Gandolfini's fucking nicer ride back home already offers a detail to take him.
Mayor Gandalf, that'd be cool.
Hand off.
You shall not pass budgets legislation.
No, but this happens to me.
I am going home in a fucking wheel barrel because I'm going to Mulvaneys and I'm getting wrecked.
Yes.
Yeah, definitely.
Oh, that's what it is.
That's what it is.
He goes to a bar.
Yes, it's all the dudes.
Yes, there's because there's some other like, tertiary characters in the command center.
There's like a young kid.
I kind of got some lines, Maestro.
Right?
You have everybody from the office there to celebrate the maestro and this he fucking punches Michael Rispoli in the face.
Sure, that's it into the movie.
Then you wanna walk home with milk?
Fine.
When Rispoli needs the comeuppance in this movie, he doesn't get it.
But here's the thing.
Well, the first hour and 1/2 of the movie has nothing to do with the last 15 minutes at all.
No, not this latest.
Now here's the thing.
Did anybody watch this all the way to the end of the way?
What?
No, wait, no, no A thank you dinner.
But it's the funniest Fucking was like when we get to the very end.
And it's like the production companies are distributor and everything.
Each one is separated by his shot of a train whizzing by.
Why you get to hear, like the train noise turn clear of the closing doors.
Jansen.
And then every time they cut to a different like it's like Scot free as one Sony.
Obviously he's just Bush.
This it's the same wash every time I thought it would be a classic.
The last thing is like, whatever.
The last fucking production title, whenever it is ends and the last thing you see is Bush.
Then the movie lets you out.
It s o fucking funny.
Just the same wish every time.
What do you think you should?
You seeing transit?
It's like a shot of a subway way.
Leave the black of the credits and it goes to the same.
It's a fully lit shot.
She's got the subway car just whizzing by a camera, the same one.
It happens, like five times.
I didn't know I could lose respect for this movie.
I didn't think it was possible with that in mind.
Steve say, like, would you recommend this?
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, I think the originals.
A legit great movie.
It's great Matthau and it's and it's like Thank you.
It's just it's tight and it's got, like everything that has its place in the screen Planet all kind of plays out perfectly, and this does not do that.
And I mean, like, you could see that they're shooting for get a great actor in Denzel.
They get a great actor in Detroit.
They get a great actor in trouble, too.
Sometimes when he's got a director knows what to do with him.
It just it's not there, it's It's a mess.
It's awful.
I think it's probably Scot's worst movie about that's saying a lot.
Duty had some stinkers and life laws thinkers.
I mean, he did have some good movies, too, but this is awful rules.
I mean, it'll be we'll do it next Monday.
It rules with a capital C.
If the air there is a 1998 made for TV version of this right that has, like, an opening like Party of Five.
You can't You have to buy it doing that.
Well, Edward James Olmos changed almost No, James.
What?
Edward James.
Almost Odin often.
Ah, Frio is the Robert Schoch character.
The Travolta care.
Okay.
And Edward James almost is the Walter Matthau.
Get in that sense.
It's really stupid.
Does six minutes a really, really stupid.
But this is like obnoxious is hell.
And I was really bored to tears for parts of it.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
I'm gonna also say no for reasons cited within podcast, and the original is great.
If you haven't seen it, check it out.
It is nothing like this movie, so it's like a different movie.
It is.
So if you watch this and preparation, did your homework go back and do your real homework?
They watch the seventies version.
Um, yeah, I'm gonna recommend home with you, and I'll tell you a direct opinion.
I'll tell you why you're fucking leaving Netflix.
Yeah, definitely in a body bag.
Because, dude, Travolta is so hilarious.
Yeah, it's so fucking bad.
This is like, you know, and let it be several several years from now whenever he leaves this earth and we have to We're having discussions of Mountain.
Where's from now?
I'm gonna call it 20.
What is it?
2022.
The good Travolta's and the Badger bolted.
This will be the shining star of the overacting and the ridiculousness.
Yeah, and it's so fucking hilarious.
And I will say, though, like the rest of you said, Go watch that original.
It's fucking great.
It's so good And some good fucking Tony Scott.
I don't know Beverly Hills cop, too.
The hunger Will you ever see a movie that has faces like Walter Matthau and Martin Ball Some and fucking Hector Elizondo and Robert Shaw.
So people there, like I thought, this is what we need in movies again, like we've lost our threat.
It's all pretty bold.
I know I need some fucking old catcher's mitts on schlubs, some oddities.
But the thing is the way you do when you get these faces, you need to like, age them, like with cigar smoke for years and years and years.
Yeah, It's like they have to be people that have lived a life as drawing from that life experience in there acting not being a baby model.
That then just pretends to know what human, human life, ISS and our British as well, all source.
You're always British.
Um, I thought I had something else about this, but I guess not.
We've got a lot of fun here.
Todo No, I was going to say because similarly, with television just speaking to they've shows like Frasier and Cheers.
My God.
Cheers.
Yes.
Look at it.
Look at it.
Just look at 11 seasons of that.
All right, well, the most, like, the ugliest person you could see in something now is David Harbour, whose handsome is fucked is incredibly handsome.
Wow.
Here it is.
Another given another shot at Remake Town taking a Pelham 123 David Harbour as the two like that.
Anyone see that one owner writer clip with David Harbour that's making its way around the internet.
