That's a final week of vacation.
Nobody really wants to pick up the house, but you have to because you want the deposit back.
Pick up the house.
Yeah.
Our cabin that we rented the beach cab can't lift that.
I am not going in that rascal in room, I think I mean, I mean all the blood.
We haven't cleaned it once.
That's how we come up with ideas for the next season.
Is we just go in a room and beat the shit out of each other?
Everyone's always like So how do you pick up a swords for?
We hate movies.
We go in a room and beat the shit out of each cabin.
Looked exactly like Darth Maul in that Mexican was Lucio borrow massacre?
What?
Yeah, Sorry.
No hablo espanol.
Well, that would be great, though.
If on this show there was just a dude that was a luchador, we didn't know his identity, But he was just like, you know, the flying black widow or something.
Sure is just some dude you want some Mexican wrestler I let into my house good title for a movie.
We're also anonymously unfamous.
We might as well be wearing masks.
I do apologize that we also have the same today.
Uh, yeah.
I'm sharing a cabin for a while.
That exactly the voices blending.
And I don't mean this cabin either.
No, he hasn't been shared.
Someone's been hogging it.
So we're here to introduce the, uh, the final rear And which is, of course, Star Wars.
Episode one The Phantom Menace.
Ah, lot of lot of good stuff going on in this, but this is a while ago.
This is one of those ones.
Were way still people like, Oh, man, you got a Phantom Menace movie that we did.
It happened.
I feel like every few months were like, Yeah, we did Well, you know, over 200 episodes, they're not all available on the main feed.
Right?
So now we're releasing it on the mainland.
Now, get ready to keep on asking us to do attack of the clones.
Now you get to do something always Well, audience force awakens is coming.
Better bone up on your prequels.
Yep.
You want to be prepared?
You wanna watch movies?
The new series is totally gonna ignore.
I really want to be up to date on all those movies they're gonna ignore.
You know what?
I This is sad, but I'm like, Is there gonna be a Liam Neeson?
Forest goes I hope that there is.
They're probably going to do something like that to kiss the fucking ring.
Wait, who's wearing this ring?
George Lucas.
Both of them, man.
I mean, I said string I mean again when these things air.
We're recording these months in advance.
But it's a months ago I said, I think and it was kind of a joke.
But the more I think about it, maybe not Ah, Kwai Gon Jinn Stand alone Star Wars movie might be pretty cool of you.
As for free Oh, this is that The storm troopers are coming in.
They took my daughter.
I've got a special set of four skills.
I don't know who you are, and I don't know what spaceship you on, but I will find you and I will kill you.
Oh, no.
Bye bye, Jen.
I bide Trick doesn't work on space out, baby.
It's I guess I'll have to use my kung fu trouble.
My daughter was kidnapped into some sort of space sex slavery, but they're plenty space sex star Bainian.
It's his job's palace we were talking about.
So enjoy Star Wars.
Episode one The Phantom Menace will see afterwards.
This'll was Ah, this was the most uninterested I've been in our source material.
Hands down, hands down the history of this podcast.
Holy shit!
Get this 50 plus titles and we're talking like fucking robots.
And, like, really shitty romantic comedies from the nineties Kralik zero budget movies.
And this is It's a disaster.
It's a absolute disaster.
And I'm gonna get this right out of the way.
He walks the battle friend or is a better movie.
Yeah, without a doubt.
Yeah, I have no problem with a more enjoyable you could.
It's more cohesive.
Follow it.
It's 90 goddamn minutes.
Yeah, Thank the Lord for that.
I mean this We sat through two hours and like, 13 minutes of this fucking trade embargoes and land ordinances and all sorts of regulation, it's all gobbledygook from beginning to the end of this is all right now I'm a Star Wars nerd to the utmost of the original trilogy.
You're a fanatic.
I'm a fanatic.
I'm a total for that extremist extreme.
If I was that he's not the one reading all those books.
But I'm gonna put that at The Phantom Menace, pulling the strings, trying to make it look like he's the bigger geek.
Oh, holy shit.
That that explanation of your, like, devious plan made you the bigger geek.
Yeah, I know, but I mean, and I When I first saw this movie, I convinced myself that, by the way, we are talking about Star Wars.
Episode one The Phantom Menace.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was so frazzled just reeling from this movie.
I completely forgot to tell you that we're talking about the first prequel to that new trilogy anyway.
Yeah, and I convinced myself I like this movie for five years.
That's astounding.
And but just and I mean, like, I realized what I should Well, I mean that, you know, in 2004 I came to my senses.
Hold on.
That's garbage.
Yeah.
And now we watching it again.
And goddamn it, 2012.
It is one of the worst fucking pieces of shit I've ever seen.
Which begs the question, though.
And I put it out there while we were watching it.
And maybe some of our listeners can weigh in on this huge issue also.
But I mean, you know, it's one thing you know, to see this movie younger be like how?
Whatever.
It's a movie.
I don't know that bad movies exist and whatever.
How many people have yet to grow out of that?
Like, how many grown ass adults are out there wandering the earth right now?
Saying The Phantom Menace is a good movie, I think more than you would think, which is said.
And if anyone here is listening this and be like, Well, we have movies, but this is a good movie I grew up with, You know, I was born in 1993 or something crazy is what you're wrong.
Sit down, rewatch it, you know, or just listen to this podcast cause we're gonna help you figure it out and then go back and watch it be like, uh, put on glasses.
Have a couple black contributed adults for once.
Look back, we'll see, and I will Actually, I'll continue our physical, my physical description gag from earlier.
Yes, none of us have a ponytail in this room, Nor have we ever know there is nary a ponytail to be fine.
I'll tell you this flat out, like we just watched it.
I can't tell you what this movie's about.
Like there's there's a trade embargo and some sort of scandal and Darth Maul is hanging around and quite Gunjan gets fucking cooked at the end of this movie, which is hands down the best part.
Oh, there's also a race.
Oh, fucking race.
I mean, that's the thing is I don't know said it's this race of jar jar like creatures.
They also the I mean, Steve, you mentioned it right before we started to record, which is there's no reason to hold our audience hand through this movie.
There's no reason, I think, like religiously go through the plot.
I think we should just kind of try to figure out the most confusing and acid nine points of this movie because it's just a big amalgamation of bad ideas.
There's, like a 15 year gap between the two movies, and during this time it was all Lucas kind of sheepishly smiling like I got three more planned.
Don't worry, I'm just gonna wait and it's gonna be a prequel.
It's gonna be this whole great story about how Darth Vader came to be.
All this stuff, all the stuff that wasn't in the original trilogy.
Oh, that must sound.
That sounds pretty cool.
I'd like to see that.
You're gonna see it.
Kids.
Just give me a while and I'm really working on these scripts.
Working on what?
I mean, here's the thing.
If this was the finished product, like, I want to know what the rough draft looked like.
Yeah, because what seriously could see?
Like, I think James Joyce wrote Ulysses and less time that he wrote Episode one The Phantom Menace.
And it's a fucking disaster from a screenwriting point.
What's all right?
I'm gonna just gonna propose a jumping off point for us to start a dive into this mess.
Um, one word races.
Ah, because holy shit, this is the most racist movie since the birth of a nation.
Yeah, without a doubt, we sort of open on this.
As you were saying, this trade embargo between it's like little fancy planet Italy.
They will be like Venetian fuckin Italy.
It really is.
It's just wall.
The more marble, it's really gaudy.
And then these Vice Roy's are like of the trade federation have the embargo on this planet for who knows why.
It's who knows why they want to give these.
Well, they just trying to squeeze money out of them like it's kind of like a protection racket, I guess.
Oh, it's so space Mafia.
It's kind of like the space Mafia.
Yeah, they, um Oh, like who?
Manchu archetypes.
Really uncomfortable?
It is.
It's just these tented fingers, and I mean, like, this is what they sound like.
That's not how do you think she suspect an attack?
I don't know why we must move quickly through this all communications.
Does that sound like a really horrific fucking description of a Chinese person?
I mean, yeah, it's awful.
It's It's it's it's the most racist character.
I think the year 1999 ever saw, and it's, you know, it's It's the idea of it is is like, obviously, look, you said Fu Manchu.
That's kind of where Lucas, you know, you always loved like the Flash Gordon strips and that that's kind of where it came from with this, but you just can't do that.
19 nineties.
You can absolutely not have these.
Charlie Chan looking and sounding motherfuckers running through your movie, controlling this abyss tree like Just give it a rest and I again like I know it's a thing.
It's George Lucas.
He holds fucking power over everything.
But why?
I could no one be like George?
Can I talk to you in the bathroom for a second?
Listen, George, this is horrific.
Lee offensive, but it's a traditional storytelling device.
I call them like I see them.
Thea.
Other day I was stuck in traffic and I looked at this guy and I was like, There's my movie, but that guy is Prime Vice Roy.
I mean, we're talking about trade federation drivers here.
What's insane is that there's, like, a bunch of these characters of the start of the movie, and then we sort of there were whittled down to two.
And that's even worse because then they become, like, this kind of comedic racist team.
Yeah, you know, just the two of them.
And they're all their scenes like them being like, Oh, no, the sheet is calming.
No.
And you're just like holy shit, this back and forth.
Racist gag.
Oh, no, the city.
It would be so angry.
If we don't get it, do you agree with together?
It's just it's the worst thing ever.
And you know what sucks?
That's not even the tip of the iceberg of the racism in this movie.
No, you've got Italians, you've got Jamaicans, you've got it.
Just it just It's a Jeff Foxworthy record you were trying to do here.
But this is not what I love about Star Wars and to top everything off with all the racism that's going on.
The icing on the cake of this whole thing is that a gigantic thread throughout this entire movie is slavery.
And this person's a fucking slave and you're my slave.
And this is I'm gonna buy this person and slaves, Slaves, slaves.
Yeah, a lot in the world and no one's upset about it.
No one's like all of our, you know, our big characters that are moral characters.
Quiet Gon jinn, Obi Wan Kenobi And where the hole is just a fucking slave.
What do I care?
You know, I I also don't really get is like the These civilizations have been around long enough that each of them have evolved, which whatever somehow got to the point where they have intergalactic fly.
They're going from one into the galaxy, the other yet and the building like Robot Helper.
See three p R two D two battle droids, whatever.
And then they're like, You know what?
But we still need that.
You know, that that raw, muscular of human slavery, like way still need that yet they just can't get over.
And it's to such an extreme Anakin Skywalker.
A slave is building.
See Threepio, a slave for him.
It's just like slaves are beginning slaves now in this society, like it's the most twisted fucking social structure ever created.
But what they don't understand about the slaves in this movie and they are slaves, and they they're not permitted to do anything that the Italian guns Oh, looking motherfucker.
I don't even though Mr So Betty or whatever.
By the way, Giacomo's abandon this guy is He lives in a backwater town.
Not even most Eiseley Most espa you.
No way we can't get it.
We can't afford both Eiseley, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, Lucas can't afford to shoot on Masa moving two towns over.
If this guy can't be fucking afford most wisely, so he's living in most Espa and he is a bad mechanic on Todd to wean the Outer Rim territory, right?
Yeah, and the mechanic And this guy has tons of slaves is better than everyone else, you fucking slaves.
And guess what?
They're not doing shit.
This entire movie, that's the other figures you're just kind of owning.
It's like it's not slavery.
It's like human trophy casing.
Yeah, because he owns Anakin Skywalker and his mother, old Ma Skywalker.
But they're just hanging out.
They have a pretty sweet house like there's there's upstairs and a downstairs.
There's a nice little patio that led quite dungeons hanging out on Given Jake Lloyd all those blood tests later.
Yeah, yeah, he's got a house.
He's got hobbies, like what?
Kind of every Look.
I'm glad that he's not getting the whip, but at the same time, like why even have a slave then?
But I think that it's almost like they're sort of, ah, misusing the word slave.
Like in this society, they don't understand what slavery actually is.
It's like you have to make these people do think I feel like this has become us bad that he's not treating a slave's poor.
I'm certainly not mad.
I love the fact that the Skywalker's have a pretty nice, you know, like middle income living, but like, what are you doing?
Calling them slaves.
Like what?
What is keeping them from saying?
Listen, little Italian flying things like, Get out of my face.
You don't own me.
First of all, you're like 1/4 my size.
I could put you in a box and keep you in a closet.
You know what I mean?
I could enslave you.
What is keeping them first?
Because they don't even live with him.
That's the other thing.
They just go home that they live two towns over.
I don't understand how this guy has Whatever ownership rights over the sky Walker family, it makes no sense to may.
We're talking right now.
We're in.
What?
This?
This is the wormhole of this movie.
That sucks.
It starts a minute 20 and ends minute.
Like our and our 05 Yeah, it's definitely over an hour.
The middle 45 minutes of this movie where they go to tattoo in that could be resolved in 15 minutes.
But they take their fucking time and then what does the one responsible him in the race?
How can you do this?
Not under the public credits.
I think the ship will be the entry fee that it's in good order, except for the parts I need, what with the body he smashed up of my partner.
S O.
Okay, So a little bit of the plot that, I guess is they go to tattooing why they go to text in the beginning of the movie.
Ah, Obi Wan Kenobi and Liam Neeson's Kwai Gon Jinn.
Right?
Uh, run afoul of the train trade federation, and they have to.
Then they go to Nobu because it's being fucking persecuted.
And they're like, Oh, well, take this ship to Khorasan, which is this kind of really when you're a little kid watching a Star Wars movie, growing up with the other stores who curse on this is the planet that everybody's always talking about.
You never see because it never really had the budget for it, right?
It's the big city planet.
Yeah, it was at its, like its invention of the expanded universal, I think I don't think it was even really mentioned.
No, you're probably right.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I think they included shots of it at the end of return of the Jenna in the special Re released yet there.
Because it's all like this celebratory like they're celebrating all over the galaxy.
Bullshit, bullshit, Bullshit.
But yeah, yeah.
Oh, man.
I'm gonna finally see Curse that.
That's awesome.
Oh, wait.
Our ship just got a mechanical problem.
We got shot by some fucking remember classic Star Wars universe, By the way, some things just breaking down.
You know, you don't really this Lisa's movie addresses because, like when you take off from a spaceship, you could like a hit a duck or something?
I don't know.
Space duck yet.
Space trucks from end or the space chickens and all that other shit they had first you walk movie?
Yes.
So, you know, they just they fucking blow a tire or whatever the fuck and have that Aniket says Fudge too quiet.
God.
Hey, what if the washing is babbling talking about a Christmas story?
It wasn't really fudge.
He actually said something.
Really.
Star Wars, the offenses like their furniture.
So they blow a town and bumble fuck world.
They're like, Oh, shit.
We have to go to this shit ass hillbilly planet with her slaves.
Three only planet in the galaxy that still has slaves for some reason and, you know, quite guns.
Like, Look, we gotta fund, you know, are hyper driver Mick.
Book lock thing is broken.
We got to go get it fixed.
Let me go haggle with this Italian and why you come into my store.
You don't have a no.
Oh, I have these space crediting.
Don't you use your for girls?
That is something you could pray that when you tried to tag Oh, the Italian You're there for, like, two weeks.
Exactly.
This this should be like, all right, if you wantto There's so many things wrong in the storytelling way of this is like one.
If the move Anakin Skywalker, Let's get to him before minute 30 please, to Why the fuck does Anakin Skywalker have to be a child?
Ah, little baby man.
In this movie, it makes no sense.
It makes absolutely no sense.
And three just picked him up with Let's fucking go.
Let's get to chorus up with I do think so.
Because we have to like that.
That's like Lucas's whole idea of, you know, creating this world.
And he thinks like he's he's really, you know, getting into these characters go.
I think that even with the original trilogy, right, like that's still ah, bit of a criticism about it is like there's all these hollow character.
Sure, So this is what happens when he tries to make every character have its own importance.
Is that quite literally, every character has some friggin thing going on that has to be addressed for no less than 10 minutes.
So everything even let you get like the Italian mechanics problems.
You know, he's got like, a bad wife at home.
That's like ragging on him for some reason, you know, and he just can't stand it.
But it's against his religion to get into boards from our ship you got here.
His sob story.
It's their scenes with just him and Jake Lloyd, and they're talking in there.
Bob would do how Bob a boat language, and you're just like, you know what I signed on to this movie for you and the fuck MacGregor.
And you know what?
Liam Neeson's a great added bonus and where are they right now nowhere because of in this fucking intergalactic MK Cannick shop with the fucking flying Italian Bumble bee gone Zo thing.
That a fucking little turd child who's rambling off in this language where there's no subtitles, I mean, and that's another thing.
I mean, like, you had r two D two in the first movie.
Oh, you don't know what he's saying, but he's talking to somebody who speaks English.
You've got, you know, it's just back and forth.
Bleak Block liberal blogger respond like but with our two and see Threepio, for example, like you know he'll be like bubble wrap.
And then he's like, Oh, how dare you!
And like, responds with a question and like remains what he said Accusatory Lee or something like that.
Yeah, that's not this.
It's just them gobbledygook in back and forth and nothing's getting translated, and nothing's happening because they're just looking at each other.
So it's just like a useless, like two or three minutes a check tag that happens more than once because he also talks to sell Bulba outside like some galactic diners Bulb Megan Dibaba, PSA Boba.
Just like shut the fuck up, kid.
You would you're dead eyes that kid has knows, sold.
He's a radical fun of jump, so they're there.
And the whole thing is like, Yeah, like Liam Neeson's got all these intergalactic space bucks and this attack refuses to take him.
So he's like, Okay, Levi's is essentially trying to write a space check.
He's like, he's like he's waving his ad.
The check will not.
Oh, yeah, he's a generative personal check.
And he's like, No Ben 10 Picard or here yet?
No, that's totally right.
He doesn't have any idea first.
No, that's actually kind of a funny part is he does try the old Jenna in mind trick on this Italian, and he's like, Oh, I'm a fucking whatever That doesn't work on me.
Convenient story really does.
Says works on him.
He's like, That doesn't work on me.
Only money.
What's money works all over.
This fucking guy also works on me.
I just think that this character is done with the subtlety of Father Guido Sarducci, by the way.
Oh, yeah, absolutely s Oh, yes.
Oh, he's like, all right.
We can't come to any sort of agreement of payment.
Apparently, nine minutes later, you're not gonna take my fucking diner's club card.
So we're gonna gamble on a Padres, and then this is the fucking black hole of this movie.
Winner takes slave.
Yeah, Winner takes slave and hyperdrive part or whatever the shit.
Yeah, and by the way, quick Gon Jinn is sensing something in this little boy and he's like, this little boy's got he's got some Jedi powers and I don't know how it manifest itself.
Like, you know, I think I think you mentioned that he he's like a pod Range was like, Oh, to be a Pied racer, you must have, like, a reflex J.
I like reflexes, catlike reflexes and like so he's like, Yeah, yeah, you do.
You're really great.
So maybe you want to come fly home with me like that.
Here's what happens.
A priest goes into a bumble fuck town and it's a child for his own purposes.
And he's like, he's telling the mom like, Listen, I'm gonna take him.
I'm gonna teach him all sorts of things.
He's gonna have a great life with me instead of being your slave.
He could be my slaves unit, but I paddle on learning with a little hair.
But first I'm gonna need to cut up his arm and take blood and then send it.
Took to Rome by a computer the Vatican to see to see what we're talking about here.
Better Cloyd wise.
Because, of course, that is Medic Laurean's What was invented for this movie to be, I guess, with the unit of Measurement for the Force.
I think that's where you can gather Is the Maur medic.
Laurean's in your bloodstream.
Better, Better Jenna, you are fucking come on.
Everybody like this is like this is really falling into a nineties trap because in all nineties movies, there's gotta be a results on a blood test.
Yeah, it's fucking Star Wars.
DNA evidence.
Absolute.
It's like I'm watching the fucking pelican brief.
And what's ridiculous is it doesn't even stop there, though, because not only do we have this science aspect of it, but then crazy Star Wars religion world gets thrown into the whole thing because isn't that also where because he sends the test back and they're like, Oh, this is weird.
It's almost 100% Medic.
Laurean's in his blood.
Yeah, what could that possibly mean?
And he's like.
Well, that my theory is that means that the father was 100% medic.
Lorien.
What?
So he was just birthed by the force?
Yeah.
What the fuck is Jesus?
You know what?
I never thought I'd say this.
Give me E walks any day.
Yeah, this is You know, another thing is like when they find out Luke Skywalker has force abilities.
And even when they hint at, like, Prince, just lay also is possible to be a Jedi.
No one.
No one ever fucking says the m word.
You know, had no say they come up.
No one's rolling this leave up in a galaxy far, far away.
It doesn't make any fucking sense.
Like in all of the Star Wars universe ever.
There's never been a mention of blood, blood if never, ever.
Why?
Because when people get killed in Star Wars, there really isn't any blood or so in those re releases where he made damn sure there wasn't any blood coming off of that fucking ice monsters arm and whatever other shit's going on.
So why?
And this is the other thing.
He says I've read things and seen interviews with him where he says that that shit's been there from the beginning.
You are lying jerk, sir.
Yeah, it's bullshit.
That's that's all his thing is.
It's all reverse engineering.
And the idea that I have now must mean the idea that I had 20 years ago is fault, which is such fucking spurious reasoning.
I can't even get into it.
Well, now it's like the whole thing with, like this is coming out in three D and then the other two prequels might be three D and whatever, and it's like again.
So you're saying that, you know, because of your like, revisionist mind that you have, you know?
So you're saying what you always envisioned these movies to be in three D, even though when you made these movies and came up with this idea, you were living in a time in where three D technology was so cheap and gimmicky that it was considered a complete joke, invented solely to try to get people back into the movie theaters after the advent of television, which was killing the cinema.
So you're telling me that ah, fuck ng technical idea that was a poison to your art form was on original part of your whole master plan.
You're such a lying, turkey neck piece of show, you know?
And that's another thing about this three.
Anything.
I guess some people think this is a new trend in cinema.
I feel like every few generations they try to pull three again just far enough so that you forgot it existed like they tried it in the early eighties.
They tried it in the fifties, and it's for better.
I mean, for most part, it's fucking garbage.
Like I don't even understand the point of it.
Do the timetable matches up.
It's like a weird fuckin rare meteor shower.
Like every 30 years, the movie industry is like and three D's back.
Isn't it great?
You forgot how much you love three D and I'm sorry, everybody.
Let's just start this right now.
The point of this podcast this specific episode is so we can start a petition for people to fucking boycott seeing this phantom menace in three days.
No.
Yeah, that's that's the whole point, is what we wanted to do.
This is honestly, it's worse that the movie itself is worse than you remember it.
Yes, And if he has said like, OK, Phantom Menace tanks and the theaters.
I won't do the other two and three d will.
Listen, we wanted to tank.
Everybody should want this bucking venture for nothing more than financial gain to just take Yeah.
I mean, you're gonna be This doesn't hold up well at all.
Like the c g.
I and these creatures and even the spaceships fucking annoyed me.
Looking at them how fake they look.
And if that's gonna be flying around my fucking face, you get about it.
What?
Just out of curiosity, what George Lucas might need this money for.
You think that there's a bunch of scientists working around the clock that have the cure for turkey neck within their grasp, But they just need another 100,000,000 to get them over the red line is a fucking put it about three d.
I just need to get this thing off my face.
I think that's completely blows.
And they keep on warning more than they keep up, making up bullshit like he does.
Oh, no.
You're actually a medical council.
Love Any more money?
Oh, no.
My men.
A chlorine count.
Slow, quick.
Put another one of my movies back out in theaters.
So anyway, this pod raise itself.
Yet there's there set up that there's this bad guy named Sapo Ba who's got like it was so weird.
Uh, what do you call it there and beauty like he's got no legs and he's got these big likely are really weak legs that he like, eats with, and he's got these giant arms that he walks around on.
But yes, you know, alien, whatever.
It's kind of like a crab, like he uses his feet.
So, like, yeah, like you said, like eating whatever else that he walks on his hands because because that's created and it's got like a dog head.
Yeah, as faras creature designs in this movie, he's one of the best.
Yeah, he looks good.
You know what, though?
It's still a CG creature.
It and that's another thing that you see in his movie.
That's just we've mentioned it before, but again, it just does not work.
You have puppet creatures and the CG creatures like interacting like there's that one part where ah ah jar jar banks like knock something over and this big fat it's like a big fat puppet suits like a guy in this.
Oh, yeah.
Terrifies.
Yeah.
Okay, what are you doing or whatever?
And then it's like a guy in a suit talking to a cartoon creature.
Yeah, it just looks awful.
Like it's such a bad idea.
And in this movie to there definitely is a shot of totally digital Yoda.
Yeah, but the first of many, uh, do you do get Puppet Yoda?
You do get a puppet Yoda, who looks exactly hilarious, like Mark Hamel.
For some reason, I never would have thought it unless you brought it up.
But we will have some, some clear as day Yoda screen caps on the Facebook page.
This puppet Yoda is designed to look like Mark Hamill.
I don't know why I like it's because he's, like, kind of younger.
Whatever.
There's less wrinkles and Yoda's face, I guess.
But he just looks like Mark Hamill, and it's really weird.
Like what is that trying to say about, like the Star Wars genealogy like Maybe Yoda was the father may be.
Yoda was Anakin's father.
He went you was flying around town, she got a fucking flat tire, and this slave was like all fix it.
The fuck ter.
It's like it's like the devil's advocate.
She had all these claws on the back of other back.
Maybe if they did like sequels instead of prequels, you'd see Luke Skywalker as Mark.
Camels slowly grow into a Yoda.
You just like Luke Skywalker just lives forever.
Yeah, you just like he slowly becomes, like, smaller and greener older on like you started to do this.
And maybe that's what all Jedi Yoda is.
Just like what Jen I look like with a little Why not?
Sure, I will.
Completely by that, that's it.
So the bed is on, right?
And, you know, and there's all this pressure.
Not only all right, so we had all this stuff.
We've already met Natalie Portman's character.
She's kind of playing this double role, which will?
I don't even know.
Forget it.
Okay.
It's basically like it's like this weird, like Princess of the Prince of the Popper scenario is right.
Like she is.
She is the queen of Naboo, right?
And she's got her double for security purposes, played by an unknown Kiera Knightley.
That's how she got her start.
And the whole the whole thing in the movie, which I didn't even remember just because I just I completely blocked this movie for the most part.
And you just think of you know, Natalie Portman is Queen Amidala, and that's the fucking end of it.
But in this first movie, you don't know that she's the queen until the way end of the movie or what.
There's a big reveal when they're on that frog planet or whatever.
It was a great a second.
Is that a reveal?
And you guys were like, Yeah, it's a crazy twist ending.
I totally just forgot it.
And I thought that she was just trying to trick quite Gunjan so she could come along on the adventure.
I mean, which she waas.
But I thought that the audience was in a that was a little phantom medicine over.
Oh, that was a little phantom menacing of your her own.
Yes, So I mean, look, we've got all this like her planet has been enslaved by this.
Well, to be fair there, they're withholding some trade routes towards our planet, and there's also camps going on.
There's although they by this time they have.
They have come down to the script, right?
Cause Darth Sidious was like, just do it anyway.
Go invade.
Yeah, it's a corporate army.
It is a corporate army.
Think about it.
And her planet's been invaded by these droids.
There's fucking camps.
And here we are on tattoo Wean waiting for the fucking buffalo to get fixed twiddling our thong is taking in SP Spectator sports lady.
But it is It is such cinematic thumb twiddling like you're totally right and it's just it's this big fucking race.
And the whole thing is to show you that he has, you know, Jet, I like Super Jet.
I potential, you know, like in is in the race like his pod racer starts breaking down and he liked fixes it.
No problem.
Like he's very smart and all this stuff like and it's fine, but just tell me that his body's pumped full of medical or Ian's, and that means he's gonna be a great Jet I and I'll believe you.
You can.
You can feed me that line of bullshit.
I'll eat it up and we could just get on with our movie.
But it's like that you can't have this kind of a race in the middle of a movie, or even like the other 2/3 into a movie and not let it be the ending.
You can't just run at the one hour mark.
You can't have the last game in the Hoosiers movie played and just expect people to bounce back from that.
Yeah, I feel like in a Star Wars movies like this, like I feel like it should have been if you'd have a race, have it be like a chase, you know, like having some being fleeing.
There's a life and death situation instead of, ah, freedom or slavery.
But it's also just like friendly competition like this is just what these people do on Saturday, although, although Sybil did try to sabotage Anakin Skywalker and he, whatever fixed it, one guy crashes and dies, looked in the fuck do.
Although there are Tuscan raiders with with rifles just shooting at these patterns, just which I found a basic I don't know what that is, what that's even supposed to suggest, because they're just the little scamps of the planet, like tattooing like they're like the rats of, you know, and it's like when they're shooting at you like, Yeah, it's a threat, but it's just kind of like it.
Ah, love.
It's the test.
They got anything better to do like they don't have good on television and watch your holograms, whatever little care for your sports of racing entered, edit like engines.
Well, maybe it's a thing where, like, cause their day as the Tuscan raiders are really opposed to, like the tattooing approved slavery system on their like, You know what?
Everybody's equal.
We're just gonna live out in the desert, you know, we're gonna be out of the cursed earth and you can have your slavery, But we're not gonna be a part of that.
And they're operating like this underground railroad that we don't really know about.
So they're actually tryingto help Luke in a new hope.
But it was misinterpreted.
There's that language barrier that hurt, hurt, hurt.
If the universe could just get together and, you know, learn each other's language and just evolved with one another, that wouldn't have happened.
The Tuscan raiders would have saved it, and it would have been a completely different movie.
And so I mean, he wins the fucking race.
I mean, like, really, who cares he was the race.
He's like, he's not gonna win this race like anyone who was ever had any suspense over this goddamn sequence that lasts, like, 13 minutes.
So fucking it's like a 13 minute rate.
And don't worry if you miss anything, Greg Proofs is narrating it for you.
Yeah, there is like this ridiculous two headed narrator one.
Speaking of gobbledygook, universe language and the other one, it's just Greg groups.
It's straight out of a Popeye cartoon like There's no eyes big like unlike biologically incorrect Creature is just standing there and it's all it's just a big week at the audience and who cares?
So so he wins the race, and Levi's is like, Great, you're gonna come with me now and live with me and your mom still gonna be a sleeve.
Isn't that gonna be great?
And she's gonna die alone.
Yeah, that's what again.
It just makes no sense because, like Anakin Skywalker goes up to quiet dungeons like Listen, man, like, sure, I'll come and learn all your circus tricks and whatever but like that room in that ship for my old lady and he's like, No, I'm sorry she has to stay here.
She's owned by that big Italian over there.
What?
What is keeping her?
What fucking is training?
Heard of this desert planet?
Just just get on the ship with the rest of them.
Mom Skywalker and just go.
What is the problem?
I I don't think he wants his mother asking all sorts of questions.
I think that's really what it is.
You know, the original Siri's characters would not stand for this bullshit.
Try to sell that load of shit, The Han solo fucking shit up a smuggler Smuggle you slave.
I am a fucking hero.
And as a hero, I rescue people even though it's Han solo and he's a little bit of a reluctant hero, okay?
Like he's still gonna do because he knows he's got to do the right thing.
But that you're right.
That's a thing Where, like, technically like that fucking Italian bumble bee would probably just be like, Oh, yeah, You could take her with the wind can get out of here, both of you dead pizza.
All right.
Down to her apartment, to someone else or yeah, Or Italian bubble all you son of a bitch.
I'm gonna take something from you and you fucking whip out your lightsaber.
Get go on your fucking going to gondola!
All right, pal, Because I'm taking this lady and the boy.
That's true.
I really think it comes down to Kwai Gunjan.
You know what I like?
Not for nothing, but Obi Wan Kenobi is just He's grown up a little bit.
It's not as exciting anymore that he what we're dealing with here.
I don't want to say that it's a definite thing.
It's a possibility.
Like you said, Stephen Monk rolls into town, picks up a kid, tells his mommy's gonna teach the kid all sorts of magical things and leaves.
It may be for the best that quite Gunjan doesn't make it to the end credits of this movie.
I'm just putting.
But there was that, like, that could be an easy racket to do because he doesn't really show off his four skills down there in front that mom and he she it's a dude in a robe.
It shows up to your desert house and says, I want to take your study special on he just let it have it.
No, I mean, and that's the thing is like because she's a slave and she has no option.
But there's no fucking reason.
In retrospect, there's wife.
She doesn't go on that ship.
There's no slavery.
It's just it's all a big fucking facade.
No one is enslaved in anything.
They have an awesome townhouse that I would kill the fucking living.
You're not a slave.
If you have two stories on your house, you're not.
You have a house.
You're not a slave like it makes no sense.
You don't know.
These people are called slate.
There's no bruises.
There's no nothing.
I mean, like, they don't have income, but they have food, You know what I mean?
Like they have their taking care.
No one on this show is, uh, condoning Lavery it anyway.
But if you're gonna say that someone's a slave in a movie, make sure you know what slave means George Lucas or there's a chain somewhere that they can't go anywhere because there is no chains and no one's watching her.
She could have just fucking like there is not having a goddamn fence in this movie.
Oh, there's no fence to be found.
Magneri offense.
It just It makes no sense.
I'm sorry.
She should have got on that ship.
And I think quite dungeon just didn't want around there for his reasons.
By the way, One last thing on Tattoo Wean.
Even though we're in Moe's espa Jabba the Hutt cameo, you got around your right and there's like some gag at the end of the day.
And you know what?
It's probably the smartest inside joke of the entire movie, the end of this 13 minute long Padre sequence.
Everyone's like, all excited or whatever that Anakin one, blah, blah, blah.
They cut up to the stands.
Job of the hut has fallen asleep, and someone like goes like, Oh, master job like taps him on his fat slug shoulder.
He wakes up.
Oh, is this sequence over with?
This is the job hunt.
This is a lot slimmer since, like 19 eighties, Marlon Brando versus 1995 oil in France, so he had turned that corner and then jump of the hunt was still getting roles that were worthwhile.
This is before job.
It was only on that day.
Yeah, I used to go into the bus's big due to at this time, so I think we kind of have to just get into him.
He was mentioned briefly what we talked about the the spectrum of racism in this movie.
But can we just Can we get into Jar Jar Binks?
There we go.
I'm really reluctant, but yeah, I guess we wait because it's almost like everything's been said already.
I mean, that's the thing is like, I don't want to sit here making all the job the jar jar jokes because, ah, it's just treading the oldest of water.
But, I mean, he's just that because it's kind of the next step in this movie after they get everything hurt.
No, it's not.
I'm sorry this comes before, does it not?
Yeah, way takes him to the other planet.
Yes, the fucking Frogs space sequence or whatever, but I just want I mean, I want to put out there the most ridiculous part about this character.
And it's not that, you know, he talks like a racist like minstrel character or whatever Anything like that.
It's the fact that the beginning of this movie, when you're introduced to him, he's like this petty thief or whatever, like he's just a shitty criminal Yeah, And they're like, Wow, look at this degenerate or whatever, and everyone in this fucking town hates him, and they're like, we don't want you here anymore.
Jar, Jar Biggs and Liam nations like, Oh, this will be the perfect guy.
Tow Lead us through your fucking shitty water city.
Well, there is this the oldest of old, like non religious things that people put in movies that have fake religions is Oh, you saved my life.
So I'm indebted to you forever and ever and ever, which is complete garbage, right?
And s o you know, he starts following them around there, really annoyed by him quite on Jen and Obi Wan Kenobi.
Like God, what the fuck is this guy's deal?
And they're like, how do we find the The best thing is ah, you McGregor when he first meets it.
Because what's this?
What is this?
It is It is again, like I feel if if we went back and really, like, come through this movie, there may be a handful of these, like the creators of this movie being like, God damn it, we know we're getting paid so much money from George Lucas and whatever.
But we fucking hate this because you have the hilarious job, a sleeping thing, and then this charge our introduction where yet he quite literally is saying, What is this?
You're right.
The whole audience was thinking the same thing.
What is this ridiculous cartoon character?
No.
And he, You know, he turns into this thing where he introduces them to this sea, the sea world of the Naboo, which is his race of gunned un's where there's this big, fat Reginald vel Johnson looking motherfucker running the whole thing.
And it was a big drug.
Well, my, my thing that I was bringing up about the most ridiculous part of Jar Jar Binks to the fact that beginning this movie, he's a petty thief and through this whole movie, he does nothing accomplishes like kills in battle by accident.
And it's all just like this hammy of comic bullshit.
At the end of the movie, he is awarded like something fucking metal.
Like his people, he's a general.
Yes, he's like General banks at the end of this movie.
Like we mentioned this sometime in the past about how easy it was to move up through the ranks of the Star Wars universe.
But I'm telling you what, like someone forgot to sign something somewhere because, like this is the worst idea for a promotion I've ever seen.
Yeah, he's nothing but God damn sight gags always falling over himself.
How is that a leader?
That's not.
And it's just, Yeah, that's all he does.
He stops the movie, Did what?
Every shows up, got shitty one liners.
And I mean, like, people out cried of This was and you know, that's the problem of Jar Jar Binks.
He's like the figurehead of the shitty nous of this movie because you'll hear people be like, Well, if you ignore the Jar Jar Binks, it's kind of a good movie like No, it's not that.
That's an argument people use.
Yeah, you people act like Jar Jar is what tainted the prequels.
If that was like eliminated, it could have been something good.
But it's like it's just not it's just a mess.
Regardless, that's a bunch of bullshit.
Yeah, like if you remove that character, it's still a horrible shitty movie.
Case in Point Jar Jar Binks has nothing to do with that 13 minute pod racing sequence I just sit through?
Yeah, exactly.
And no, the Vice Roy's.
Uh, yeah, totally.
He's got nothing to do with those vice rise, like nothing that I hated the most about this movie has to do with Jar Jar Binks like I hate Jar Jar Binks.
But you are a fool to sit there and say that he's the worst part of this movie know exactly.
And we, you know, we get back on that.
We run a fella Darth Maul because we could talk about to sure.
And I guess he was like Does Well is is really, like weirdly iconic character just from design alone.
And like the fact that the only two things he does are the best things in this movie.
Which of the two fight scene, right?
So, like he's like, Oh my God, it's really kind of a smart way to make like he is the Boba Fett of the new trilogy, a couple good scenes, and then he's gone very, very little to do, and people really reacted to him really, positively.
But like he just doesn't do anything.
He should have been a presence in this movie.
He should be a menacing thing that's always there.
That's always kind of popping up at the wrong time.
But he has to fight scenes and says, Maybe four words.
Yeah, there's that one part where it's a It's a total missed opportunity where he's, like parked his big space cruiser outside of Moss Espa.
And I'm like, Awesome!
Like he's spying on them like he's gonna go into this village and fucking murder people.
How cool is this gonna be?
Because I saw from the preview and my Burger King Kids Club back with his fucking action figure that this guy's a badass and no spies from afar and then sends a bunch of little drones into the city to do, like some legwork on investigating the main characters.
And that's it.
Well, even Darth Maul recognizes that it's a child.
You don't attack a group of party when they have a child in it.
Yeah, Darth Maul would kill kids.
I would love it.
He would be great at killing kids, but George Lucas disagrees.
If you just fucking go rsm with his horns and that would be great.
Like if he was bad in that fight with quite dungeon.
If you just fucking head butted him likes it.
Is one, like, breaks off and leave me since forehead and both their faces was covered.
That's how you gotta make these movies your dark.
It starts licking it office.
And also he did, in revenge of the city finally grow the balls to kill kids.
Because there's that one scene when all the like jet eyes were getting wiped out at the end or whatever.
And he just he comes upon like that little group of pad wands or whatever like at a study said, Just finishes of all light saber on and we cut and we know exactly what happened in that scene.
That's a brilliant piece of editing in that revenge of the city.
I'll give that movie that, but yeah, I mean, like, so you know, that's your villain.
Your other villain is Palpatine, who we meet when we get the chorus on a more re away.
This is the best part of that.
This guy damn movie.
When it came out, people were like, Oh, is it Palpa theater?
Is it not a city?
It's not.
Help it.
I mean, it's obviously poverty, but you didn't think you'd be so goddamn obvious.
Yeah, like, Oh, maybe it's not.
Maybe Citius is not ever Palpatine because that'd be really fucking obviously done.
No, that just goes to show.
Don't think too much with Star Wars prequels.
And by the way, in the future, we mean the carry on on the Darth name.
Okay, So I'm gonna keep calling you Darth Vader all that.
Don't you fucking call me Dutch cities.
Yeah, M perp.
What?
You know what?
Like they're they're like, they're they're they're They're, like, hanging out with each other, like, one night in the command room, like it's just the two of them, or never.
And, you know, Darth Vader just lets it slip in, like, awesome city.
It's like that would happen.
Like that's one of this.
We should have.
We're, like, two great leaders.
Like getting a room, and it's like, All right, Jim, I need you to do this for me.
Yeah.
I can't do that.
You know, it's like, listen better.
You're gonna sit down and you're gonna listen to what I say.
No city is You've gone too far like that.
Conversation has toe happen.
If you're telling me you wrote all the shit, you lying son of a bitch.
That should have happened in one of those 1st 3 movies.
If you If you have a guide, you have sift name.
It's got to get used.
Yeah, especially with another ship.
You sit.
You having a beer?
What?
I would love it if it's just like, you know, they're having a beer.
Whatever.
And he's like, Yeah, give me another one city.
It seems like it's Emperor Palpatine.
And then there's that moment.
You believe in this shit anymore, man, Thistles are That was your religious name.
Okay?
Don't tell me what my religious name was.
Vader.
All right, I made you.
Let's not.
And this is the worst part about Emperor Palpatine.
He's not the type of candidate you want to have a beer with.
So we get back and we be Terence Stamp, who's in this movie?
Yeah.
Welcome to the show.
Terrence.
Sam, come on in.
Chancellor of the Laura, I would have lost 10 bets.
Really?
Terence stamp.
The number is in Phantom Menace, like, Absolutely not.
That's that's hogwash.
I would have remembered Terrence.
Damn Dustin Hoffman in stone.
Exactly.
I'll tell you this.
Steve asked me what?
Terence Stamp doesn't this movie.
What is Terence Stamp doing this movie?
I have no idea, because he's there for a scene.
He says something to me, I think Natalie Portman and then fucking spreads wings and flies away.
He's the head of the Galactic Senate's.
Okay, stuck and then Pat, Um A because she's an evil bitch votes no confidence in.
Well, I'm explaining why she's evil.
Yeah, they votes no confidence of alarm.
Gets him.
Ran out on a rail for the black senator.
They shoot that Terrence, step back into space like he's a goddamn Superman to again The Phantom Zone again.
Yeah, don't gauge is stuck in that class.
Hey, but whatever Donkey alien was with voice by any bird be traveling so bad.
Everyone votes like, Hey, pappa team, He's a cool dude.
Let's make him chance and she's like, Yeah, I'm all for that And that's and that's the story of Hitler and that's the end of everything.
That's true.
Yeah, that's when Palpatine put down his pain brushes and decided to get into politics was with one phone.
But here's the thing.
I mean, like, you know how the team kind of engineers that like you know, you whatever he's Phantom Menace is little situation a little bit, but he does have a meddler.
Might be.
That's the quick engine origins.
Everson.
Zero The Phantom did learn this'll.
His mother realizes that his son's getting fed like there's there's gotta be that next day.
Did you not to go all the way back to Palo Tattoo it.
But there's the next day after your sudden leaves, when you kind of start re looking at the evidence and feel like shit.
Did my son just get kidnapped?
I don't even get paid.
Yes, but I just gave away a slave, Really good slave.
And now fucking catch it.
Tory's on my ass.
If I were a real slave, I'd have twice the work in front of mae eggs that I'm not.
So I'm gonna go sit on my veranda and be a space lady.
Look, lucky space slaves gets that kind of record.
I'd be set, but there's Yeah, the the the Senate What I like to call the Bobster party because it's it's all these Dracula's.
That bookie bed from all corners of the galaxy is The problem is George Lucas goes fuck it overboard with these aliens, man.
Because the original Siri's, it's predominately humanoid people.
Even the aliens are usually humanoid.
Yeah, they just have, like, a little bit of, like, makeup on or whatever.
Although in new Hope there is that hilarious Where wolf, that is just can't It isn't honest to goodness where we'll do hope.
Why didn't he do?
Aware will see prequel man, that had been a little bit better than this movie.
And I don't know why.
Why does the universe gets so less populated with these aliens after the politics of Is there some type of inside we don't know about?
Possibly because all white Brits and a new hope in Empire on.
Then I guess you know what years would happen?
Probably so much genocide that they're like, Listen, this this whole came situation we got going is, like, really tedious build the death star.
One blow will get it over with.
We'll just start going planet the planet.
Yes, wiping them out.
You know, it's true because in these movies, especially in this the first time we see this big senate which appears in all the other prequels, you just have all Yeah, it's a big old monster or any Somehow, between that fucking revenge of the city and into the New Hope, All the monsters went away and they were all replaced with white British actors.
I don't know what happened.
Yeah, the director.
Kobe's fucking I don't know.
Fan club.
What?
What happened?
There were so many bullshit rate of aliens in these prequels.
I'm surprised.
The hamburger Helper gloves.
It wasn't in the city that anything.
I think there's some e tes.
There's like I think there's some tin cans that talk like it is out of control.
There's there's two wookies that first of all, are made to sit in the back way, and they just, like, kind of stand up and cheer when pad may comes into whatever and it's it's just too Chewbacca.
Yeah, by the way, you'll notice no Tuscan raiders whatsoever because they work outside of this government because they don't believe in it.
It's not you.
Listen, if they went in there and they were like, Listen, we want Tuscan raider representation in your intergalactic fucking senate, they'd be like, all right, fun.
We've had your desk waiting for you since Day one But you people decide to work outside are bogus, Avery says.
And then they throw a bunch of tea intothe Well, that's probably why they don't let him in because they're trying to have these Senate meetings.
And then whoever has the floor is getting like rocks thrown at him by the Tuscan.
But that's actually a really good point, though.
And that's what happens.
You look, you're telling me that the first on Onley person to say hey, I can run the galaxy Better is fuck it outnumber Palpatine.
There are billions of people of this fucking said it like all it takes is one vote.
Never.
Rabble, rabble, rabble, and chew out there.
Fucking pods idea.
Yeah, you're right.
No, you're totally right.
Like you're telling me In the history of this sentence existence, there wasn't Narry a person who was like, Hey, I disagree with that.
Yeah, the fucking Hercule Lloyd's of right there.
They must be pissed off.
Maybe it's common practice and we don't know it.
Like maybe maybe a Terence stamp gets ousted every year.
Yeah.
This body is not capable of action.
I suggest new leadership is needed.
I miss the veg of no confidence and chance of Lauren's leadership.
Now they will elect you strong one who will not let our tragedy continue so he gets out.
And that's kind of that's actually the only real thing that happened to this movie.
That's of any consequence to the narrative of Star Wars, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, No, because that's you.
That's that's what starts in motion, like the chipping Away, because by the end of that third prequel or whatever, like that whole Senate fucking falls and you know he's got that big fight scene.
And it's the start of pal proteins.
You know, the size of the power.
Yeah, it's the rise of the Empire is it's all You know what this is.
Kids at home always vote because one vote makes a difference.
You see it here?
You could see it here in this intergalactic senate.
One vote, Terence Stamp was out on a rail.
And here comes the Empire.
If someone else stood up against Palpatine getting in there, who knows?
Terence Stamp still could have been president of the Senate or whatever the fuck goes on there prevented this whole like Terrence.
Look, here's the thing about Terence stamp as a leader.
You know, he made a lot of promises about change.
And, you know, in his first term, he wasn't able to do so much because he had all the tractors.
And he's got all these goddamn alien screaming, gobbling.
And in his second term, he could without the fear of being ousted, he could really begs a difference, right?
If he's not worrying about whether or not he Terence Stamp is going to be re elect, yeah, he can just do whatever he wants.
And he doesn't have to listen to anybody because he is the president of the Senate.
Exactly.
Know, backwards wear wolves yelling, Adam, that doesn't even matter anymore.
Now, here's the thing I want to put out there.
One of the last times we spoke at length about Star Wars.
We proposed a pretty awesome idea of an HBO set.
Wire s, you know, Ah, Cloud City with Billy Dee Williams older now as Lando crown hangs heavy.
That whole business Here's something that I just kind of thought about that you know Aaron Sorkin If you're listening, let's maybe get this in emotion.
Inter galactic Senate.
Okay, look way before the rise of the empire like way, way back.
Aaron Sorkin, West Wing Type the inner workings of the intergalactic government.
Everybody's just walking and talking, you know, like one episodes about like, you know, some wookies come in and they're pissed off that their plan.
It's got, like, this climate crisis, but the Inter Galactic Senate's not reaching out with any kind of aid.
Yeah, the Jon Spencer character is actually just a cup of dirt because who cares?
Covered dirt that talks and gets upset.
I would love to see, like, the eighth season of that show in the running out of ideas for different creatures.
And it's just a talking Rahman cup.
It's bad to him, so I mean, yeah, that's then we're kind of in the last throes of this movie, which is the best part of this movie.
Like once we get off tattooing Once Palpatine once Palpatine takes over the Senate and there's this big standoff on Naboo, we really kind of get what you paid your I guess line bucks at that time and the boo battle was terror.
Oh, yeah, with the with all the battle bots and on what?
And those frog people.
Judge Biggs.
The gun didn't wear whatever.
Yet the gunman's decide to help the Naboo because apparently they have all of the military power on that planet but still are subservient or submissive to the white.
Why do these little like it makes no sense in a galaxy where, like the new booze, obviously physically stronger than all these white people something with, like, why isn't fucking Chewbacca telling fucking Han Solo where to get off?
Why is the six foot tall where Wolf Monster over brown brains over brawn?
You think I don't know.
I just think it's one of those things where it just takes one.
And I'm not saying Chewie and Han, because I know they have a good thing going about.
Their relationship was fine.
But if you have a thing where it's like, Listen, this was this other rookie mechanic is working for this other like, you know, intergalactic heartbreaker and whatever and, you know, they get into, like, a scuffle or whatever.
And this week he just grabs this white bread motherfucker by the throat, just puts him up against a wall and just kind of does the planet of the apes like Nome or kind of and then, like, kind of sets the wheels in motion for, like, Listen.
Hey, everybody, we've been asleep for hundreds of years.
Were huge fucking monsters.
And these air, just white people.
You figure it out.
I feel like the part of the dynamic between the Han Solo true Baka relationship is like Chewbacca sort of needs han toe like navigate that human dominated waters.
That is the original trilogy I'm like with the Empire of taking over.
But I feel like back in the prequels, the aliens should be telling the humans what's what.
So is it right?
Because because in the future, all these aliens and wipe that so obviously to box to be like, press the issue.
So you say it like it's easier for a wookie to get by in the prequel University should be, Well, that fuckin Senate seat.
At the very least, that's true.
They did take that Tuscan raiders.
That was cash kind of whatever That planet that we placed a live.
I'll say it again.
That Wookiee planet.
Forget it.
Totally awesome.
No wonder Yoder goes on vacation.
There is that shitty think.
The third movie, where is it a true pop, huh?
No, wait.
Is Yoda Dojo.
Chewbacca is all the gin joints in all the world.
You walk into mine.
Shoo vodka.
Oh, can we talk about the unnecessary age difference between Anakin and Padme, eh?
Yeah.
This is 20 year's.
It's just about it does.
It's one of the many.
The multifaceted.
This is a bigger conversation of Why Start your story here.
Are you an angel?
What?
In Angel?
I know the deep space pilots talk about the most beautiful creatures need universe.
They live on the moons of Diego, I think.
Funny little boy.
Why does So you've been You've been teasing this for years.
The fucking the birth of Darth Vader.
What happens to make this What's supposed to be a really good man into this monster, right?
I don't care about him.
Is an eight year old boy?
No, Not at all.
Because unless it was a thing.
Like, if you want to tell the story of Darth Vader and it is as such, he was always a dirtbag.
He was always He was like a fucking like Damian kind of kid.
Then that's one thing, cause then he got this little kid running around.
He's really dangerous, and he gets his hands on a light saber and kills people or I do it.
I'm doing this for you, Anakin Clack.
We'll do it all for you or started at the tipping point.
Don't start it like 10 years before he starts going a little iffy.
Yeah, if you know.
But maybe not starting that.
The tipping point started, at least with him as a functioning adult.
Who knows what an erection is saying Because, like this whole movie, judging from his dialogue in this movie, he really knows what direction days.
But he was talking to pad man.
He's so, like I was saying, all these suggested that he's just like I know it.
Are you an angel?
Like That's a fucking lie.
Don't e half this movie's pickup lines either quite got to him or him.
Let me tell you something.
Are you an angel?
By the way, listen, Jake Lloyd, she's a queen.
She's hurt him all.
You got to come up with some better shit than that, buddy.
But so, yeah, why not?
Because that's what that's the problem with.
I think we were talking when we're watching them.
We were talking about, like, you know, I like that third movie, but it felt so rushed, I think.
Eric, you said yes.
And it did.
Because it took We started so far back that by the time shit started happening, the whole trilogy off nine hours is over now.
Yeah, exactly.
Like you could have done that Revenge of the SCIF.
That whole third movie, he could have just been Darth Baby later.
Yeah, like, start for, like, over revenge of the Sith with that fucking volcano fight, which is totally awesome.
Yeah, like, have that be the first scene of the movie somehow, Like, rearrange your stories.
So that's what's going on.
Yeah.
And then you just have this whole movie of him learning to walk and talk like Darth Vader doing shit in killing kids and all, and actually hunting that agenda, which is something that was supposed to be the bread and butter of this trilogy, which is probably short of this fucking Padres.
It is.
It is.
It is like a five minute montage where you just see all the Jedi knights just murdered at the end of the movie.
And just it's it's It's quite literally like one seen dead, Another scene dead.
Another scene yet kids debt.
How cool it would have been if there was a whole movie of Darth Vader as Darth Vader going around hunting down Jen Ai and killing them, like taking its time like like staking out his prey.
And just because in the revenge of the city, like towards the end, it's just like I feel like there's 100 kids really banging at those imperially uniforms we like.
We need this for the last shot like yeah, least establish the garb.
I mean, I can't believe I know exactly.
He's got to be, like, walking around like getting like he centers in on the first Jedi knight.
He's getting there, schedule down and their habits.
It's like fucking Henry portrait of a serial killer.
But with Darth Vader, I I want that, you know, a new hope enters and it's it's It's like all the Emperor Empire has been around for a long fucking time, and it's been brutal.
But then, according the prequels it's been around for would like 15 years less than that.
Less than that.
Yeah, I don't get it.
Who gives a shit and yes, but yeah, you're right.
And then But the other side of that is why Why it's so weird to start your movie this early is you have a 16 year old girl flirting with a nine year old kid.
She should be baby city.
Yeah, totally.
She could be his baby sitter without a doubt.
And you just it's it's honestly, it's just wasted opportunities.
Toe.
Hey, George Lucas, develop your characters and have it be believable when they fall in love.
Not just a fucking walk in a grassy field one day.
Whatever the hell they do in the Clone Wars movie.
Yes, you know, like actually, like work towards building something.
But you can't do that because you've decided to make the male part of this couple.
Ah, child.
And it's useless.
He could You know what if you want?
If you want to keep all your dumb pod racing ship, you can still have that in.
He's just like a teenage fucking gearhead.
You know, he loves racing pods, but he's fucking 16 years you could play into, Like Lucas is interested like fifties car culture and American Graffiti.
In a way a little bit of figuring this out for him later.
Like yes men to be like No excuse.
I think this is a teacher getting an F paper from a student in being Oh, you do so much.
You do such good work, George.
What's look?
All right.
If this was your this is your first paragraph, right?
Let's develop these ideas together.
Let's sit down.
And you No, no, no.
This is how this is your thesis.
Fuck this shit.
It's so annoying.
The, um, the battle on Naboo, I believe, like we talked about how that's like, it's totally, like, bogus or whatever.
And I'll say it right now and I don't know, Like what?
He's suped up for the blue rays, and whatever it is, I'm not gonna watch it.
I'm not gonna care.
We went through this on a DVD.
It was like the first round DVD, because that's all we needed it.
You know, that's not gonna sway your opinion of a movie.
But those of facts, man, they do not hold up the stockers.
Yeah, it's all It's a big fucking It wasn't like a little window screen saver.
Yeah, totally.
I was waiting for a flying toaster tow walk way He's in the Senate.
Well, sure, Like the flowing toaster race on this universal Senate is not being represented fairly.
We are of the green vortex.
Sees things that bounce around your computer, and we think we're that big represented by the Senate.
We are the never ending rows of colorful pipes that continue to go around yours screen all over and over again in an endless maze of confusion and beauty.
And we are being underrepresented in this intergalactic senate.
And I standing alone the dancing baby here do declare, you know, you get Thea pyre is right, man, You got in this just right out.
Saloon that shit down.
You could say good bye.
I mean, how much can we Governor s?
Oh, here we go.
And this, the best piece of all the other music in this movie is kind of Who cares?
You don't even notice it.
John Williams score.
But finally, and I'm gonna fuck it out myself as a nerd duel of the fates Stark's plan.
Holy sh That which was releases that MTV video and one TRL at least three times.
I mean, I've never seen is just clips from the movie.
It is.
It was like an extended trailer.
But it was this It was better than the movie because it had, like, the good parts.
And it's just all the fight scenes and shit, Mostly the lightsaber.
So that starts kicking in and all of this.
You know, uh, there's a big dumb battle on the boo with between Dar Jar Binks Peter Sellers in his way through this fucking heard of battle bots.
Yeah, and then Anakin Skywalker also Peter Sellers in his way into a fucking flying machine that goes up to the guest.
There's, like, a command center up.
Yeah, it's a very oops won the war up.
I would be Oh, he really Ernest p World's his way through the end of this fucking Well, yeah, that's a war after efforts.
I'm sorry, Peter Sellers, because it's just a lot of button pushing like, Hey, what does this do?
Oh, I killed three people and it's just him, like, Hey, bird, what's this button do?
What's going on over here on this?
Uh, yeah, it's totally just like in his mind.
He's just playing a video game.
Yeah, and then So they're doing that.
And then Ah, Natalie Portman and almost Dennis Haysbert are run through the streets of the boot to take it back and get these fucking filthy Fu Manchu is out of get their greasy hands off the rest drive off the planet.
Exactly.
They're trying to get the hell out of there and oh, my God, There's actually a lightsaber battle.
That's why really fucking cool in the middle of this talk about I didn't see it coming.
I'm sitting there the first time I saw this movie like they had light sabers at the beginning when they roughed up those Asian characters.
But there's really not that many light sabers to be found in this movie, and yet, and it's a pretty cool battle, like there's This is what this movie should have been, which is nineties fight choreography and none of these special effects being put into a Star Wars setting, and it kicks ass.
It absolutely kicks ass.
It's the one and only seen in this entire two and 1/4 hours that kicks ass.
Yeah, and I feel like Darth Maul is obviously just wasted because he's instantly he's in this fight sequence, and that's the end of him.
But, like, I feel like, Why eliminate your big mitts?
Like does Nader was, and at the end of a new hope that continue him on and then maybe have Vader strike him down to take his right.
I mean, that's I mean, that's the thing that Darth Maul in this movie serves as like the big time thug in a Bond movie, Right?
Right.
He's almost entirely wordless.
He just kind of shows up to be menacing for a second and then leaves.
And then here we are, the end of this movie.
He's just gonna have a big fight.
Where again, he just doesn't talk.
But he's gonna fight the hero and get killed.
And that's all he's ever.
He's fucking Jaws.
Yeah, that's it, But no.
But the funny thing about this is he gets replaced as an apprentice by Christopher Lee.
Yes, I 90.
What year old Christopher Lee is somebody's of Prince pregnancies is his pal pities boot black like 85 years old.
Well, you know, maybe age just isn't a thing, you know, in the Star Wars universe, because Yoda lives to be like 600 years old.
I guess if you're 700 years old, there's a scrappy and 90 year old.
I mean, I guess Yoda just really hated Luke Skywalker was like, too old, too.
Will be getting the training, but But apparently a 91 year old could learn the ways of the force.
Exactly.
So, whatever.
I mean, it's a really cool scene.
Yeah, right.
Secrets.
You know, quite Gunjan gets fucking gang to buy a fucking lightsaber.
Yeah, he gets one right, The old gut, which is pretty sweet.
And Ah, you McGregor cuts.
We could tell that you MacGregor for a minute here because he's barely in this fucking movie again.
Yeah, like he and I feel like, uh, to just kind of be honest with it.
He does the best acting job in this movie.
However, like his dedication to mimicking Alec Guinness and Alec Guinness is like speech speed and you know, the accent, everything like that.
I do feel like that kind of peters off in the other two movies.
Yeah, but at least with this 1st 1 he's really doing a good job at mimicking Alec Guinness.
Yeah, his hair grows in it.
That is the one thing there is inconsistent hairdo for him in this movie, which is the dumbest fucking haircut.
I mean, the rat tail stays the same because what you gonna do to modify a rat tail, I guess other than the length, but like but like, the length of his chop top or whatever is just all over the fucking place.
Yeah, it doesn't make any fucking.
It's medic Laurean's guys.
And I mean, look you.
McGregor is a He's a great actor.
He Yeah, he's had a great career.
He's in the middle of a great career like he's not going anywhere.
Like you put up good movies every year.
The best thing you could YouTube this There was a press conference.
It was before Attack of the Clones came out on.
The title was so hush hush is like, Oh, what's this title gonna be?
What is totally gonna be?
And it was a press junket for Malin Rouge, you, MacGregor, and met Nicole Kidman just like taking questions in France or whatever.
I guess I didn't know it.
Cameras rolling and somebody's like, What do you think of the new title, the Star Wars movies and I was like, Oh, I have no idea What's the What's the new ah Episode two titles like Attack of the Clones And he bursts out laughing like me that this policy admits laughing, too.
It's amazing it.
I think that's what you McGregor was doing in this movie.
These movies, like It's a job man, you know, a job like Andi.
Here's the thing.
And I thought about this at Tau.
Put this out to you guys, too.
But I think the Ewan McGregor mentality is something that I would go along with because at the end of the day, like all right, fantasy world, someone's coming to me.
Hey, Andrew, we want you to read the script for the new Star Wars prequel.
Well, I don't need to read it because it's Star Wars.
It's gonna be the hugest fucking thing in the universe.
I'm just going to be in this movie, and you know what?
When I get to set and I'm reading the script or whatever and it's dog shit, I'm not surprised.
But I'm like, You know what?
I'm still in a Star Wars movie at the end of the day.
Absolutely.
Yeah, you kind of just have t o.
If I take the role, you have to roll like you take that wrong.
You know, if you're asking me to be in Phantom Menace, I guess I guess I will.
But you're gonna be the spirit of the Flying toaster.
Everyone's gonna do their part.
Three, this is Dick.
So this whole thing concludes, we get the now we have movies.
Infamous.
Quite Gunjan, cooking up Viking Funeral for only of seasons.
Just got a big old apple in his mouth.
He's got time stepped up his nose Rose buried his belly, but forgot about this part of this movie where you know, it's a star with tradition where they they burn their dead in a really Viking weird way.
Yeah, but everybody just kind of watch.
Is it?
Yeah, they just watch them burn, man.
They're just watching them burn.
And it's weird too, and I obviously get it like you're not gonna You're not gonna like, strip him completely naked and just set him on fire.
But the first shot you see, like the fire is roaring so much and it's like shitty computer fire.
The only way you can tell that there's a body in there because his like left boot is hanging out of the flame.
And there's just like this boot kind of getting charred off.
But like the other thing, that's kind of rude.
Like I get it like it's intergalactic, you know?
It's whatever.
It's their law.
We have to sit here and watch this.
But not everyone is quite as well behaved because Ewan McGregor is talking all over this fucking funeral that Jake, would you like?
You're my apprentice now.
Like I'm gonna teach you how to be a Jetta.
And he's like, I'm not sure if I want to do this, and I'm sitting there like, I don't think this is the appropriate venue for this conversation.
Do you think you McGregor?
It's a deleted scene.
He puts his hand on Jake Lloyd's children look and the line of abuse, and I I'm really glad you never had to go through what I did.
I'm so happy he's dead.
No, i e I could have gotten through that force field quicker and stopped.
Well, I mean, I've really tried, but I'm glad I did.
Just that man was a monster.
I mean, I know Darth maul look look like he was the monster, but it's really it's It's what's on the inside.
They do late.
I'm quite thick, don't they?
That Darth Maul is the DeVille, by the way.
He's got horns, A red phase.
I mean, it's just just the devil.
Like, Why do you need an intergalactic devil from the helpline?
It I mean, that's Diablos.
684 There's a volcano planet.
Maybe he's a native of that Velveeta.
Other Darth balls like farming, because that was the bit of discussion we had before.
We turn this on, though, whether or not that Darth Maul faces face paint yeah, and I'm sort of in the camp of That's just his face.
It's not like battle paint, right, I'm sure.
And I don't I think that that that would stand to reason that comes from a society where tattoos have gone too far.
A possibly because if it was face paint, you would think there would be an awesome moment where, like quite Gunjan punches him in the face, and it sort of rubs off a little bit.
It kind of looks like when, like the Terminator gets shot the face, it's just kind of fucked up a little or it's like the ultimate warrior.
The second he gets into the rig, it's all fucking all over the place.
What an absolute waste of money.
The ultimate Warriors face paint collection was him.
Sting all those idiots that paint their face to be a wrestler like that.
Shit's coming off with the first elbow blow.
You know what I mean?
Gotta glad.
No idea what you're for, the better.
So that's it.
That's the movie they award.
Like Natalie Portman awards the frog people like some shitty ball of energy that looks like one of those.
Like you.
You touch those plastic balls at Spencer's.
Gifts of the light goes on your finger.
It's full of smallpox.
Get it home and like bringing underwater with them.
And then it explodes and poisons.
The pond has bullets.
You never see that fucking that those people ever again.
No, you don't.
So you know what?
They probably were just totally wiped out judges the last of their race because the other you want to talk about a shitty last shot of your movie.
By the way, it's framed with, like the Frog King in the middle holding this ball up in the air.
Natalie Portman's off to the side, kind of looking at him.
And then there's all these like nobody extras, just cheering.
Where is everybody?
Where's Ewan McGregor?
Like no one is on that stage because no one gives a shit about that Italian planet that, you know and, you know, at the end of it, there is no hint.
There's some hints about, like, you know, Yoda is very reluctant to take in Aniket, but it seems more bureaucratic in nature, but there's no hint that he could be the death of them all is the end of your fucking movie.
Yeah, And there's no dark twist or dark because the thing is like, you like, you wanna have this?
Yeah, you're setting up like the origin stories of this monster, and you can't even be bothered to put in some little thing.
Yeah, that hints.
This might be the end of us all.
The thing about Yoda is he's like, you know?
Well, there's something off about him, you know, feeling to me.
Like he's 100% medical O'Ryan.
That's bizarre.
Yeah, you know, I don't know what that means.
exactly.
That sounds kind of dangerous.
When these prequels were coming out, I had this sense of like, Oh, this is gonna be great because it's gonna be even darker because it's about the that the democracy, the rise of evil, the people's all of them fail.
It's like fucking adventures in candy land Most No, you're absolutely right.
It's just all three of those movies aside from the last 15 minutes of that third prequel.
Yeah, it fail on every level of trying to explain to you the rise of evil intergalactic fascism.
Yeah, just fucking fails like no at no time and I ever looking at what's his name?
Christian?
Whatever.
Hidden Christian Peyton Christiansen thinking like, Oh, man, this dude is about to turn into the most dangerous man in the galaxy.
There's no threat to that whatsoever.
How How do you fuck that up?
You make the Phantom Menace first.
That's how you fucked that up.
And honestly, you don't need to show me that the old republic was, like, good and they had people represented like I get it.
I get what on idea of a republic is if your move on totally.
If you're a good storyteller, a good filmmaker.
You can tell me that in 10 minutes.
Yep.
You can use the 10 minutes of that pod racing sequence that you shouldn't have in the first place.
Boarded at the beginning of your movie.
It's called the prologue.
George Lucas.
Have that be your prologue?
Use that 10 minutes that you save.
Cutting out that pod racing sequence and tell me all about how great it was with your fucking you know, your democratic society, whatever.
And then we can just get on with the rise of you.
That's all people are buying tickets for.
What's awesome?
Is that that that beginning montage of the road Warrior explaining how like the machines stop church, that that society felt like.
Give me that.
And then give me Give me, like, evil for three movies.
Yeah.
No, you're absolutely right.
Just like the idea of playing around with what evil is, what isn't evil like, you know, like they have a morality play.
There's a little bit of morality play in that third movie, but again, it's just it's too little, too late.
I'm sorry.
I've checked out.
Give me some shades of gray Luke It's for a new level.
Jedi knight.
The council does but agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner.
I do not.
Well.
I got believed in him.
The chosen one.
The boy may be nevertheless grave danger, I fear in his training.
Lost Yoda.
I gave Clyde on my word.
I will train Anakin without the approval of the council.
If I must.
Quite Gon's defiance.
I sense in you I mean that you do not.
I agree with you.
The council does.
Your Apprentice Skywalker will be so on that note.
No one's recommending this.
Are we recommending this for, like Star Wars history?
If you haven't seen this yet, By the way, I guess that's the other thing I would say.
Noto Anyone seen Note anyone saying this double?
No.
For fucking seeing it again in three D?
Yeah.
Triple Know.
Exactly.
Just fucking forget it.
Because I'm telling you, it's not going to make a difference.
And it's not gonna look good, because you know why?
Here's why.
Any time you see those movies that weren't originally made with three D in mind and then they fuck in post production, that stuff, it's just garbage and it's a waste of your money.
Stay away from it.
Now, here's the other question.
Because I'm just gonna put it out there.
Now We're not This is this is it for us in Star Wars, we're not going to touch on the other two prequels.
So is it worth anyone seeing those two moves?
I don't You know, honestly, maybe check out that, like, the 2nd 1 has a pretty cool Jango Fett, right?
The second to have, like, hits and misses moments here and there.
But I I buy a large Just don't.
I feel like I feel like it's pointless.
I mean, maybe I would say, if you gotta check out any of them revenge of the city.
I guess I would say that too, if you really If again, if you were living under a rock or, you know, maybe you're just you were too young when the movies came out.
I don't know.
Just see revenge of the city and save yourself the trouble.
I say I think people, instead of saying these, we should see the original trilogies.
The original cut 77 80 83 the D specialized totally find outline of you Google them?
Yeah, harmonies de specialized editions.
But also, um, Ernest goes to jail.
It's not that bad.
You know what?
There's one of those movies called Ernest Goes to Africa, and it's less racist than this.
Fucking hands down less.
Ah, so there it is, the final rerun of the summer.
I want to address something.
I had a little flag because we didn't immediately jump to anti Semitism way criticize more than once for not immediately jumping to anti 70 on, you know, like I think he said that Bumble Bee guy resembled in a swan.
Oh, yeah, yeah, and he can He doesn't talk like a diese.
I mean, and I I understand also, like some people like, Well, you know, the way he's drawn, right, the bird thing was a nose job, right?
And I'm like, Yeah, I get it, man.
But you know, here's the thing.
I don't see any Jewish people with trunks.
Here's the big time.
Not not many with wings.
Sometimes it's just not as much fun to jump to things like anti Semitism just a bit.
Sometimes it's fun to just go your own path and make your own jokes up about stuff, and I feel like that.
I mean this episodes, like, what?
Four years old, there's a leg.
I'm sure that's probably what a lot of that Woz and he is kind of Abbott Obama Taboo, you know, because, you know, here's the thing.
It's a dumb fucking elephant.
Bumble Bee Alien.
Nothing.
Yeah, and many listeners at home might not have haggled with Italians in New York City.
A.
So much as we have read his book, Steve, Say Dex haggling with Italians coming out in paperback.
Actually, pretty soon, Director Guy's losing your money.
You know who does the forward it for that?
Is that the Chazz Palminteri?
It's just one sentence.
I've never read this.
I don't know who he is.
What What's this all about?
Chazz Palminteri, Man, that's a guy that likes talking about the old days locked up in a Bronx tale.
Man, I don't say over under in you, and it would be a really good coup.
I agree with you on the force ghost of Ah, Liam Neeson or Ewan McGregor.
Those like good surprises CNN movie, and I don't think they're off the table.
But how could I know, with you and McGregor, Force goes because Yeah, why the fuck would a ghost age backwards that's never made any stupid use that in the in the re release of Return of the Jedi, I think they would have the younger.
And they also put in a much younger Yoda, which, by the way, fuck all that shit.
It's absolute bullshit.
The original trilogy or busts.
I've been watching with theatrical cuts that I've been watching the harm he cuts, and I went back and I saw the fucking thing at the end.
I'm like, wasn't he?
Oh, they're doing it the correct way.
Okay, we got some listeners who work on those things and those air some of the real cinematic first responders out there.
God, Blessem, continue through this project.
I don't use the word hero lightly, you know?
But that is it, man.
That isn't number one right there.
So that's it, gang.
I will say, starting next week, the new season of we hate movies is on the air featuring your calls.
Your phone calls your requests.
