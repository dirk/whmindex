Thio World Not good.
Lower your expectations significantly.
Here's the thing, Steve.
I'll just say this choreographed dance number in a McDonald's.
I like it already and also say that Ronald McDonald was at least nominated for a ransom.
I do not know if he wonder accepted.
I saw some trivia mounted, but Ronald McDonald has cameo, which I forgot a substantive moment, I believe.
Yeah, I think it's kind of like a dais.
Ex Ronald McDonald might be like a Judi Dench nominee.
A lot of questions like, Does he tuck it in?
I'm not asking that about the alien.
These pants are huge.
So Ronald McDonald There are way more other questions that one can go in the back because, like y zero, we wet gross how to become toe like McDonald's.
How does he grow like that?
I just don't know.
How does it grow like that?
August 5th, everyone.
The Bell House n y dot com Now on today's program, this is a movie about a talking horse.
It's hot to trot.
I'm Andrew Jupiter, Steven Sater, York Cisco, Chris Cabin and we hate movies.
Theo Wait.
Movies.
Thank you for tuning in to our fine program.
As always, if you're new to the show this week, we're talking about a movie that starts a talking horse voiced by John Candy and Bobcat Goldthwait.
It's hot to Trot from 1988 directed by Michael Dinner, who's a big TV director these days.
He also directed what was a judge Reinhold, what off beat of previous up, a much better movie.
I don't know, but I will put my weight behind before we get too much in the oats year.
We should stop and recognize and thank the patron that sponsored this episode.
Our dear friend Patrick.
We had a just a quick f y I As with the time the tango and cash episode, we had a program where you could sponsor an episode.
We've since close out our patron, Trump, actually, executive order.
That was one of those one of those ones that got through why you didn't give a shit about that, but s Oh, Patrick, request this Episodes were doing it.
I think we have one or two more of these to do so much more.
You know, one that I'm really excited for wrong.
Let's save it for a surprise so that everybody thank Patrick.
Thank you, Patrick.
All of our patrons out their patrons, patrons, Hatred, hatred page Patri on.
Come on, you could see I make that mistake.
Yeah, I could.
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm not surprised.
All right, So this movie, um, this was something that was a staple in the Cisco household.
Is that right?
This was on TV a lot.
I don't know what channel the hinterlands of the premium cable dial.
Maybe, but like this would have been like a stars right when they started or something, or Cinemax or whatever.
Look, we're starting this new movie network called Stars.
It's with Z at the end of it.
And yes, all we good license was hot dry and it is up in the Highlands, kid.
So this was a staple in my cousin's house.
The other movie that I remember from that house is hot to Trot End, Mac and me.
They had both on VHS SoHo.
But wait, how did you evade seeing Mac in me?
And because it was always hot.
It was hot to trot all the time.
When I went well, they were hot for hot to trot trot.
It's a much better movie.
Can I just say this?
And I might get pinned to a wall here.
I like to this movie.
I feel so those do.
I hated this movie for about 25 years.
Real bile.
I feel somewhat vindicated.
You coming in here and saying you like what, Steve?
But what was the other movie that your cousins were putting on all the time?
Remember we're talking about It was it wasn't what you just said.
Right now, I was listening.
There was another thing where we're talking about like it was, I think was on the last mail bag, like, embarrassing movies that your family members like you looter film.
Denny, get.
Get the Fritos.
Yeah, that is a Frito film.
And, I don't know, maybe it'll come to you.
I can't think of it.
Um, so, yeah, this movie we open on a when God created the Earth, who and God might be a horse.
Yet God might be a horse, but also, like we've We've heard rumors that God himself first created horses and then decided to create people.
And I know nothing about this movie, and I'm sitting here and I'm like, that sounds an awful lot like John Candy.
Yep.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I was surprised by this.
I didn't look up anything.
About the only thing I knew about this movie was Bobcat.
Did anybody read on the Wikipedia end or the Tribune about the, uh, how this movie kind of came to bay?
Well, wasn't there a Shrek situation with this move?
Well, yeah, it was Elliott Gould, and it tested poorly.
What a shock.
And they kind of like re cut the movie.
That's why this movies this movie is held together by fucking bubble gum.
If you look at your eyes, it like this.
It's a little bunch of eighties comedy, man.
That's what they did.
But this took four tries for me to get through four different nights I had to try to get.
You are in one in one consistent viewer.
Chris.
It's 83 minutes.
It is so difficult to stay attached to anything in this mood, but there's nothing going on.
That's what's great about, just like it's so maddening.
And then there's the horse.
I'm gonna need 12 horses.
No, wait.
That's too many horses, the horse with the big glasses.

So you better believe Leo.
It's that New York thing that I just don't get.
Yeah, I just don't get it.
It sounded like the horse was going to do that.
Hover.
Nagle is on.
Whatever man.
That's what I said about signed.
Yeah, exactly what we don't like.
Oh, I don't I don't get Seinfeld's just to New York e for me to New York.
You translation fucking bagel with fish on and racist.
Yeah, well, you're right.
Also, here's one of I'll start this because I feel I'm gonna be, like, way more positive than normal on this show.
You see, some people that are like i that Andrew Jiu ping despues bile weekly on the Internet.
Oh, my God, that's mostly accurate.
Let me tell you what's great about this movie.
Constantly throughout this entire movie, aside from when they're playing different variations of we're in the money, which does get annoying.
Holy crap.
Every every other song of this movie is a fucking harmonica filled fat guy, John Candy music.
And that starts.
I mean, it was also the Beastie Boys there and fight for your right parentheses to party.
It's Danny Elfman.
I think this is gonna Yeah, yeah, music.
And you can kind of if you imagine somebody singing about a dead man's party over the music like that's a dead horse, But actually, wasn't that something else that the Tribune said about this movie was that Tim Burton turned down directing in A lot of people turned down a lot of things.
Joan Rivers was supposed to be like the lead instead of Bobcat, which you know, Wait, what?
I mean, it was a different movie.
Oh, great horses talking.
Do you know anything about the stock market?
Tell me Wadley.
Controversial stuff about gay people might be a better movie.
Yeah, it might be you.
You know what?
I don't know.
Also, you know what a better title of the only beggars can ride.
The thing that's weird about this movie.
And I love the guy and I really thoroughly enjoy literally almost every movie.
He's made the whole idea of the bobcat like comedy persona.
Being in a movie that's not police Academy sequels is kind of beer.
It's it's like if Sasha Cohen was just doing Borat.
But he wasn't called Bora.
He wasn't wearing the dumb Gracie look.
In the eighties, you had a bunch of comedians that did the like the weird voices.
Gilbert Godfrey obviously is moving for a hot second way.
Didn't episode with you.
Want to check the back there?
You go.
Sweet friend of the show.
Gilbert got sweet.
You know, there's a doc about Gilbert.
Come out.
It's playing a Tribeca.
I heard about this.
Yeah, I don't see Gilbert.
Columnist for free tickets.
Is it called Shorter than Steve saying, man, I could see the look in your eye when the elevator door over and you're going to look like Hakeem the Dream Elijah one that day.
Yeah, that was a great day.
We got to see Gilbert was putting his belt on.
It was a good moment.
We also aided a diner before he went to his house.
That was pretty sure it was to New York.
A little New York either.
You get yourself a triple decker.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You know me.
I love that trip deck.
But But, you know, there, Bobcat Gilbert Gilbert.
Also in this movie, which is also weird.
But it's amazing, Jonathan, the concert percent want the amazing Jonathan.
Sort of.
He's one of them, right?
Yeah.
Exaggerated voice.
No, listen, I don't know for sure there's a good shot.
That's just the amazing Jonah.
You think he's rocking that 24 by seven?
Yes.
Okay.
We'll also like, hasn't he been on the brink of death for, like, did you know?
Well, it's like he couldn't do that Windex gag anymore because he was dying.
Anyway, There are a lot of comedians doing fun voices, and that was just how they were identified.
Yes, and that's just how they had to carry on throughout their life.
They had to just do that short.
But I am just very dubious.
And this movie confirmed all my suspicions about anchoring a movie to him.
Yes, if he has.
Yeah, he's a co star you need You need to be part of, um a large like it can't just be him and ah, horse like And that's what you're telling me?
A cz Muchas.
It is great to hear it be voiced by John Candy.
I love the man You want to flip that?
Actually, you put you put your own candy as the guy and Bobcats force that we got a movie that would actually be way better.
Has presence like he can.
He can glue a movie together.
There would be seeking a horse.
There would be a roadhouse seen clearly with a lot of harmonica.
So I just feel like wherever.
John Candy was a choir of harmonicas with you and that at that roadhouse there's a misunderstanding.
And they get that classic John candy like, but it also gets hit with a two by, But also, you could always get a good shuffle on Oh, yeah, Maybe he recovers it.
Oh, that's the house to get wins over a bunch of rowdy bikers by dancing.
Meanwhile, his horses out back peeing on their motorcycles, that is right, eyes that's unlike Pee wee Herman.
Pee wee Herman was another one of those people where he couldn't Paul Reubens for a long time.
So if Borat got famous in, like 84 he probably would be boring.
Or Yakov Smirnoff?
Maybe Coffin probably have that problem, too.
I'm sure, like shut up for certain auditions.
They're like, Well, aren't you just the thing, Ugo, You see him getting debased in the militia Foreman movie we had or the do Latka?
Exactly.
I'm trying to sing a song.
Also not good.
So this movie is.
It's Dabney Coleman wearing fake teeth that I think Mickey Rooney was wearing and fucking breakfast.
Tiffany's farewell, my could have been Eyes is fantastic by the way he is.
The reason for my on my radar he's the best.
Coleman is, uh, Bobcat stepped ad um, Bob, that mother dies and they, uh, in the will, he gets half the company and a horse and comedy ensues the horseplay.
But John Candy, pretty much it's like, Here's what I don't like is they make John candy like when he's like, Hey, you have this talking horse and it's me and Bobcats Akhtar And then, like they go on a little road trip.
Then John Candy, like, has to tell all about like how he is a talking horse.
He comes from a long line of chosen horses and just be a talking horse.
Stop!
Just stuff it with college.
This is not that weirder than other mythologies in movies, but I'd never needed if I if there was ever a time I didn't need somebody to explain to me what was going on.
It's when a fucking horses talking like John candy just let it be.
I accept it.
If ah horse was talking like Elliott Gould, though I need some expert Excuse me.
Wait.
What is going on here?
Maybe the 66th street you like my Lincoln Center?
Oh, I got a horse at Lincoln Center.
I like that movie.
Better to That actually sounds like a title of an awesome children's book Off course.
And Lincoln's.
And it's about me going to see War Horse.
Said Lincoln, which I did when it was a play production.
It was really, really cool in.
That s O Dabney is making love.
Thio some other lady in the beginning.
The horse stable there?
Yes, and apartment set up.
They've got it.
I think one of his workers is living there or something.
Well, another guy uses it as his fuck pad.
Yeah, this this is a fuck pad.
It's like, Hey, man, one of the horses died, right?
And instead of wasting money on another horse, I converted this part of the horse barn into a fuck room.
You know how you do that?
You just You you get a lot of deodorant and a lava lamp.
Now you gotta fuck room.
I got a lot of blankets, lot of blankets, but it looks like a little boy's bedroom.
Really weird.
And you took Jack Lemmon right out of there, and you put in a fucking horse, John Candy talking horse.
The funny thing is like he's trying to make a Dabney.
Coleman's trying to make it with this lady and the horses watching.
Yes, and she's like, This isn't working for me.
Come on, baby.
And it's like, Wait, wait, wait.
Horse is looking at me with his dead black eyes.
Well, that horse doesn't know what's going on.
Horse eyes creep me out, man.
Yeah, that is pretty great.
Just just just just just marbles of despair.
Like eyes.
Yeah, the black is the horse's eyes.
It quiet eyes.
Devon's eyes picked out for the soldiers, one by one, from underneath the horse's eyes, you could see the despair, the criminality of nature right there in that moment on him.
Reflection of Dabney Coleman feeling up a lady younger than him.
How cruel is it to have God creates such a majestic creature thing, but they produce one without so the indifference to Fast Bueller's mothers.
Yes, that's what that lady is.
So I can breathe again.
I see the ticket, man.
Oh, good for her.
So he did.
The horse will represent Fat America by John Candy.
His mouth comes out of the horse, The dulcet tones of John candy.
May he rest in peace.
Uh oh.
So then he's like like I and that horse is bothering your baby.
Watch this.
And because of the little word cities like tomorrow, it's glue or whatever any, like, pulls this shade down.
And I'm like, What on earth is with the shade?
As if this has happened before.
And, you know, the physical shape Hands come and left and right.
These guys know what's up.
And this guy's re fuck goto a hotel on just paying casher with We're having an apartment for your side girl like you doing?
Yeah, I think this guy's clearly a deviant of, like, another level.
So you think he's into the animal?
Because I'm sorry.
I don't know.
I don't know how clean you keep this fucking thing.
Yes, but the whole place smells like horse shit.
Of course it does.
Pissed, too.
And I don't know about you guys, but I can't keep it up.
If there's the smell of feces and wet hay like do all that?
Yeah, but hope Maria that Know that, Chris, You're like what?
Hey, I could make it wetter.
Right?
so cold, cold and frigid Literally fucking days.
This is also better to fucking it.
Any less bacteria for sure.
Guys were, you know, we don't know Do tick.
How how the wealthy live.
And they grow up with that stable culture of having enough money for stable.
Sure they're going through And that, you know, this guy has been Ray.
His family's been raising horses forever.
So, you know, he probably lost his virginity in a very similar eyes.
It's like George Costanza with the sandwiches.
Yes, he only got, you know, horned up when he's around food.
And that one.
I'm just always afraid of power to be fucking in a horse stable.
Oh, man, Joe Pantoliano is gonna burn this thing down for the insurance money.
That's true.
That's a really fear.
Those horses are worth a lot of money.
It's our but it's even weirder because Bobcat knows about it and goes and just walks in.
He walked right and he catches him and he's like my mom's only been dead two days.
I'm not gonna try to keep doing this stuff.
It's hard.
But the man was talented.
The man is telling that he could do that?
Yeah, he can.
Is he walks in.
He's like, my mother hasn't even been put the ground yet.
And you're fucking some woman.
And like Dabney Coleman was just like, Oh, what do you say, son?
Huh?
How's it going?
You're just like all of this is disgusting.
Remind me Debbie Coleman still with us.
He is.
I had a double check that he's on.
Um, what's that?
That Ray Donovan?
Yeah.
What's that?
Ray Donovan.
The answer is right on it.
He's great on Boardwalk.
He waas.
Oh, that's right.
He was, like getting poisoned by somebody.
Gretchen Moll.
I think it's great that he's still acting.
You know?
You see somebody, these great actors this vanish into the ether.
Oh, yeah, dude, Um, just like most of the most of the rest of Drexler's class.
Just waiting for David Fincher is Steven Soderbergh.
Get a character part room.
I think you're seriously the only person I know that watch Drexel's class watched enough.
What is this?
It was like just one of your standard nineties sitcoms where teachers dealing with kids, that air, wasn't it.
Like in that block of the saved by the bell, like Saturday?
No, it was It was an evening.
That was a prime time programme.
Absolutely.
Mom, it's good night out.
So I don't know.
We're going watch Drexler's class.
Steven, get in here.
The sun setting sexless classes on because your baseball that you spaghetti down sexless.
Glad you don't know what it's like in the Bronx, right?
Nobody knows.
You watch Drexler's glass.
You like the Yankees.
You know what?
At this point, I'm convinced that this is like a blue and gold address, and you're just thinking of saved by the bell.
Drexel's class exists exist.
Ted.
Yeah.
Wait.
Do you think Dabney Coleman played, Mr Belding?
No Use Drexler Drexler.
It was his class.
And what did he do in his class?
I mean, I just feel like there's a put upon teacher.
I feel like this is a fake show.
I'm telling you, he's thinking about He just misremembered doesn't want to talk about is gonna look it up in the meantime, So bobcats like, All right, I inherit this horse.
Let's go check it out.
And he goes the stable on John Candy's like, Hey, how you doing?
I'm a horse and Bobcat lets out a bobcat scream, and then he's like, You know what?
I've been in this barn for like 10 years because they don't race me or whatever, like, let's go for a little joyride.
So they get in this horse carrier car and they drive and John Candy's like, I'll show you where to go, really going to go on a little bit of Well, the funny thing is, I'm surprised the movie continues because in the car bobcats like, Wow, it's just like Mister Ed.
And they have, like, a Mister Ed rift where it's like, Oh, yeah, you know, you you would talk to you if you had a carrot up your ass or something.
Well, is that the whole mood?
Like, how are you gonna continue that?
That's like, That's what you've been that you build up to.
If you're writing this movie The Mister Ed job.
Well, the thing about it is what this movie is is it's Mr Ed.
But like on clearly on late eighties cocaine, I think you have to get the Mr anything out of the way.
So you let the cocaine take over the screen, right?
And what he was referencing was like you shove a carrot up.
Mr.
Ed's asked to get his mouth to move, and then you overdub it.
And he was very offended that this is a This is not a real talking course.
Yeah, about that data.
But, er you know about you, but, like, how?
Might like now how'm I think of anything else when the fucking horse talks?
Yes.
Now I'm just thinking about fucking John Candy.
Shevin carrots.
If you would do it, think it was like behind it.
Usually, Method Child, the insult comic dog is just a dude behind.
Behind this horse is like Andy Circus.
He needed to really feel it.
Hold it, hold the phone.
It would be Elliott Gould shoving the thing.
Yes, original footage would.
So Elliot Gold would be the one to get 12 salad.
But like to that, like I just like now you call so much attention to the fact I'm just like, Well, I don't know.
I was distracted by mildly enjoying this movie.
I forgot about the carrot.
And certainly Joe Thing is, as as a child, watching this movie, that just that just glossed right over.
Oh, sure.
You know, and I just enjoyed a glorious comedy of this.
We've got a dirty to a lot of lot of lot of, you know.
Yeah, we stopped short of F bombs.
The weird thing is, when him and this horse start hanging out, we're not blowing rails.
Were not smoking weed when African beer.
What district soda have tap tap is all over this.
The worst of it all should blow easy blowing rails with this horse and go out of the fucking club.
Yeah, no, that's so I think the problem is it's like bringing a horse in public.
Also, you fucking team this horse a tub of fucking tab every night.
Yet the diarrhea in this apartment has to be real, the diarrhea and then the almost imminent death.
Oh, yeah, Also the dead whores.
Also, that what also that's a question.
Because if you watch the whole movie, you get to the credits.
There's no pita mention about, you know, no lives were whore.
Five Graves five.
Thought this was 1988.
When did that law come into planet?
I mean, you could kill a whole mess of horses.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, I definitely think there's dead horses on this Michael dinner had some horse blood on his hands.
But who didn't?
That's true.
It's a different era, You know Robert Duvall in The Godfather.
He had a lot of horse black holes, Michael way.
Get it.
If we try to get this shot, the horse will die.
Get the shot.
Got that shot?
I don't got a fucking three horse did by Monday.
We're filming the fucking movie.
Ah, horses purpose.
You're going to get that shot and then Hoffman in here.
Throw that horse in the pool.
God damn it.
Another fucking dead horse in this whole fucking moaning about that way he killed her.
What?
That's Ah, ability.
Luck.
Oh, using luck.
So I can't even got a trail of dead horses.
Can't even open the door.
Try to do a fucking mom along on horseback.
And I hope it a sad and I want my honors.
Hoffs.
Every morning got Huck one ifwe hook one that way.
Don't make Hoffmann, but I'm with the chef.
Could you make me a leather tuxedo out of that horse?
You Hey, my favorite part of the back story.
Here's a junk.
And he's like, Oh, I didn't get along with my horse, Father.
So I left horse home, I hit, I hit the road and I made friends with this blues musician who I also murdered.
Yeah, he's talking about like he made us watch to die.
Yeah, he made friends with his blues musician.
And then, like, the dude was blind and he didn't know that he was a horse for a long time.
And then the lady said that he would be pretending to be an Italian boy from the Bronx.
Tha this dude, like, fell out of a moving train, but they don't show that I'm like, Come on, you got to show a guy fall out of a train.

We're gonna hear I like the idea for cell, actually.
Yeah, because Because John Candy, in the start of this says that John Candy that horses, I guess he would be the Horace hell horse ride you.
Because in the start of this movie doesn't mention that there's a possibility that God is a horse like God that God made horses in his image.
Not man.

But this validates our theory on horse.
How?
That's actually I think every person who ever participated in a western from the dawn of cinema up until I don't know.
Given Also probably Louise Boone.

Did Hitler have a horse?
Probably like a vacation home, But he didn't like.

Or he didn't have a business horse, though.
Then he was a modern, addicted.
Say, Didn't tried amongst the dead.
Know if Hitler had to cross a river.
He did it in a car over a paved bridge.
He wasn't like Russell Crowe in Gladiator, but Hitler definitely on horses.

Who doesn't have a horse?
It's a status symbol.
Exactly.
I had the pony.

Just It was in the Bronx on a horse in the brown.
Yes.
That's also a children's book title is Ah, Pelham Parkway.
There's a little stable.
We we went one time there was a horse, a little horse named puddle thing.
This thing, it was having a bad day.
I was, like, seven.
They put me on this fucking guy.
You are the horse, and you know it.
It's galloping out of control.
Almost threw me in the fucking Bronx Riding horses.
Very.
It is very hard.
It's very scary.
It's really tall.
Yeah.
Then I have trauma about I haven't been in a war since.
That's not the horse's fault.
You're just a baby.
I might go to horse.
Hell I'm a little afraid I have to go to north the horse church every week.
Like when you see the horse carriages on.
You know, if they haven't like, Do you like Are you smiling?
No, no, of course.
OK, well, then you buy.
You don't appreciate their torture, then?
Yeah, that's a tourist attraction.
Say, if it was real Unbridled eight.
De Blasio ran out of the work.
We're all going a horse.
Hell, yeah.
We need to get out of this whole system.
I was excited for him to get rid of the horses.
Well, these things happen.
I didn't have, like, quite a bad a time.
I just didn't appreciate the nut trauma.
Oh, the night I was a horse and the horse like, is one of those things as little and it's like it just it was a girl like the horse had, like, a rope attached to it.
You know, it was like we're gonna walk around in a circle, and I was like, All right.
And you're up there, and it's like, All right, this is okay.
Get used to this.
So what cowboys do is like Andrews a cowboy.
I think there's a horse Just decided it, like, have a little fun.
And it was like the horse was like, I love being alive and just, like, took a little hop step.
And I went up and right down on the balls on you only need, like, five inches.
I shed second horse.
Have I wrote?
I went on a horse ride on my if there was ever a time.
I wish this was a video podcast is ludicrous.
Was screaming like McNulty hurting his own ball.
Yeah, he was jumping up and down like he had actually get into it.
I rode a horse on my honeymoon and we were like, going up a hill and the the the guide was just like coming upon us on a road.
Just so you know, like a paved road, like fucking cars on it and shit.
I'm like, Well, you're trying to get this horse to go up a fucking hill.
Yeah, So you're just like, all right.
All right.
We get up there and it's just like I'm not good enough horses to stop this horse.
It's like I hope these fucking cars.
Thankfully, the car's did slow down like, but it felt it was.
It was very scary.
Well, I just remember after, like, I was walking like the illusionist and prestige with the goldfish bowl between their legs.
Like you just say like that for least 48 hours.
Yeah.
And you look so strange.
My fucking balls Feel like a bunch of crushed grapes in Sicily.
Horse.
How?
Just go wide out of my damn it.
It's like Lucille Ball stepping on those grapes first.
I'm gonna take it a horse.
Hell, do you think they like they pull up in a nugget chariot or something?
Oh, here's a question.
Does leave the city go to horse hell or Albanian?
No Albanian.
Hell's not real, because, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of bit Albanian horses that combined with Thio.
It's like horse Hell's red in space.
The help.
I think Albanian hell is actually just if you have to spend a long weekend with Jim Belushi.
What are we doing now?
Andrew, before you probably didn't know that.
Did you watch Wag The dog is I knew he shows you his metal from Albania year, but oh, I saw the YouTube video of him getting boy pretty great.
a proud moment For who?
So whether you're watching on YouTube.
Speaking of horse held, we didn't talk about who does the voice of the father.
All right, so he takes John Candy.
The horse takes Bobcat Goldthwait to meet his horse.
Parents want the father horses played by Burgess Marriage?
Yes.
And the mother horse is played by Karl Reiners.
Uh, dead wife.
I believe that to be true.
Carl Reiner, his wife is in this movie.
Rob Reiner's mother?
I don't know.
I was making the assumption, mother, not talk.
Oh, no, you're totally right.
No, she definitely does know she makes horse noises that No.
Right.
So, no, But you're right.
He has a dullard brother who's watching watching the Three Stooges.
Lou, The brother?
Yeah, who can only speak like Curly from the three.
Studio has spirit.
You know what?
That's more than enough.
One time this joke is made like nine times really is probably a horse out, Curly.
Do all the three students, the Marx Brothers?
They're all there.
Most of the old course.
Fairly.
Chaplain.
Charlie Chaplin.
Let some fucking horse die for his comedy.
Buster Keaton Definitely hold a whole lot of second.
I kind of want to goto you're hanging out.
Legends, man, all of these.
Great.
All you got to do is kill one horse is better to fucking party and horse.
L is Mr Hands and horse.
Hell, I will, Mr Horse.
He's probably the king.
Of course.
How I will send you to heaven before is a horse.
Yeah, you're right.
Because he likes getting fucked by horses.
That's correct.
So he did any time with horses till a horse ruptured his body?
Yes.
And, of course, knew our listeners might not realize this reference.
It's to the documentary Zoo, which our good friend here, Chris Cabin, is an associate producer booster.
The best part about seeing zoo in theaters was when me and Steve, before the screening, got ice cream that was made with Johnny Walker Black and we were drunk for the people were like, We're laughing the whole time like a bunch of idiots, like a bunch of high school kids at a fucking movie.
We're in our mid 20 Tonto.
You look I can't believe it.
This man died.
That man died and were like, bucket a born.
So let's flash forward a little bit here because there's not a lot to this.
It's worth saying that the big conflict is Bobcats.
Mother has left him half of the company after she died.
Right?
Stab Nicole Women wants that half for, like, what?
$525 which is ridiculously Joe.
He's like, This guy's stupid.
I'm going to try to rip him off.
The funny part of the gag is he's like, I think you'll find this most generous.
And when he opens the piece of paper, he's originally written $500 crossed it out and written $525 which I thought was a pretty good job.
It's a pretty good day.
I see your point, dammit.
Coleman's pretty goodness, I don't like the teeth.
It's like, Come on, he's got a fake like prosthetic teeth.
What is that adding, like, you want to make him look like more of a dink?
Is it supposed to be also cause, like, the horse has fucked up teeth?
Yeah.
Looks like the horse.
Okay, which is nothing.
So the horse actually gives him a stock tip, right?
That's how this works.
Yes.
So Bobcat decides he's like you know what?
No, I'm not gonna take this buyout.
I'm going to come to work.
And so he stock trader.
Yeah, I know nothing about stock trading, but let's let's do it.
And so yeah, the horse then opens.
He's back at the stable and someone else in the movie.
Another dude is using the horse stable for fucking and he stops like, fucking, and he's like, Oh, hang on, baby.
I got a call.
Make this stock tip about the blah, blah, blah and the horse hears it.
And John Candy's like, say, stock tip.
And somehow then the horse styles a phone, which I question that I mean, I guess you do the operator.
Can you connect me to bid?
I need to see that we're talking Rotary phone one good tongue in on that zero.
You get the operator?
No, that's true.
So then he calls Bobcat and his really disguised his voice, But he's like So hey, here's this company.
Like by big Something other than Terra.
Yeah, by Ventura.
I don't know.
His stocks work.
Whatever the abide by Ventura, they're gonna they're going to do a thing, and people are gonna be excited by rocket.
And then you can sell what it's high news is this movie doesn't own the stock market, either.
That's true.
It's complete nonsense.
Also, I never It doesn't take place in Los Angeles.
I have no idea.
Nowheresville, I don't know where this.
It looks like.
I thought it was New York tour, like Connecticut or something that might just be my You know, you're twice for Getty.
Donut view of the world was weird because later in the movie ah, horses talking to a dog or something, I think, and he's like where you're from.
And he says he's from New Haven, which is a town in Connecticut, but like they're showing Bobcat driving, Ah, sports car Later in the movie, it's definitely just L A.
So maybe they're very, very lazily doing.
But L.
A for New York again.
They cut out Elliot Gould out of this movie.
I mean, like this is held together with bubble gum.
Maybe it takes place in Toronto.
For a little while, there could have been a detective who's living on the beach, which is also illegal.
Pretty sure I saw Omaha and there's somewhere, but like still like, it's ridiculous you.
I mean, we're at a point now where it goes like Is he Oh, Virginia Madison?
Yeah, What about her?
She's in the movie.
She comes in and she's like arsehole for her.
But he think probably just cause it's using this movie, I think.
Michael Madsen.
Horace How?
Yes, But here's what.
Here's what I worry about.
I worry about horse held by association.
So here we go.
Virginia Madsen also at one point hosted an iteration of unsolved mysteries, which Dennis Farina also did.
And Dennis Farina is definitely in horse.
I think it's a big step by, like Saint Horse, Peter.
I think so.
Like No, I'm afraid not.
You have to goto horse.
Well, the paperwork is right here.
Miss Manson.
I'm sorry she's not dead.
It's one of close towards heaven to clumps before.
Well, here's the thing.
If you do deathbed repentance.
Oh, I see you get out like the horses.
A Catholic.
Horace has to give you your last horse rights before it happened.
Fuck right, you got You always gotta, like have like course.
Horse Padre Nearby Man, Horse priest.
That's a sitcom because about talking horses.
Not well.
There's a tribe.
True.
Test read on Dhe.
That's I think that's all you mean, I'm sure, like Mister Ed from the nineties, it's everyone.
Forget it.
Was there a reboot that baseball cap that's exactly voiced by the mill eyes?
Yeah.
Oh, totally sure.
Horse Van Winkle.
Maybe.
Oh, maybe Like, fell asleep for years to know That's Rob Van Winkle is vanilla.
Oh, no, I know.
But I say Let's combine it with Rip Van Winkle.
Yeah.
What the hell?
Who?
Listeners?
Younger listeners might want to look up that little legend.
So the horses stock tip was successful.
Bobcat becomes a millionaire overnight.
He moves into an apartment.
The broker is played by one of two no nothing.
Saturday Night Live alums that air in this movie there in every eighties movie in the world.
Who are these gentle men?
One's a lady.
I don't know.
I see.
I see I was in feds with what about Rebecca?
DeMornay.
Morning.
Yeah.
Is feds and episode.
It might be What is feds defined feds, the fine feds.
I mean, it's like kind of if the first five minutes of Silence of the Lambs with comedy, You know what?
Yeah, to it.
The woman's name is Mary Gross.
Unlike my other comedy idea, which is MiGs in me, which is a thing gets out and sticky situations mix gets released from the mental institution.
And sure enough is put upon successful yuppy son has to take care of them, right?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, after you went to all the trouble of getting Steve Buscemi to play MiGs Alright, Dad, my boss is coming over for a big promotion for dinner.
I don't I don't want you to come out, and I I definitely don't want you to spread common his dad.
You did it again.
Well, I was about to give you this promotion, but this consummate soup is delicious.
It's like, Oh, no, I love it.
It's on Lee.
Dr.
Hannibal Lecter didn't drive.
Makes to suicide in that movie.
The other person Al, you're gonna get a grocer.
You should probably below your nose first.
But did the other guy from SNL is a dude named Kim Tim Katherine Ski.
Oh, right.
The guy that plays the evil stockbroker.
Yes.
Yeah.
Just mean these air.
Like it was like the low level eighties years center.
The Quaid season they probably co mingle.
You know how I know that guy.
He's the senator and L.
A Confidential that Russell Crowe threatens to beat up.
Oh, yeah, well, that's that's better than this big thing.
You know, it's kind of a supercut that I could you go for And I love Danny DeVito more than anything in the world.
Is Russell Crowe beating ever love and shit at a Danny DeVito?
And it's like a dream come true.
It's great.
And here's the thing.
If I recall that movie correctly and it's been a number of years since I've seen it, I don't think there's any music playing.
So it's what you do is you just put funny sounding songs over Danny DeVito.
Get beaten half to death in the House, right?
Get a wrecking ball to something like that.
Katy Perry's firework.
You put that in there.
It's a dead man's pot thio.
Totally, man, all of these things could be great.
That's a great YouTube mean that you could set up Souto watch, gets into this really nice apartment.
The horses like fuck this.
I I gave this guy everything that he know.
Rightfully so horse.
Yeah, so he brings this horse in, which is fine.
E.
He's got room for horse.
He's got room for poison Ivy's layer.
Oh, that thing on the side, Very of the atrium, By the way, growing up, watching this movie religiously, I was always saw this and I was like, Man, do I want in a tree.
And Monday, Yeah, that's a sign of success in the 19.
Not only that, but it's just like hold on a second.
We're bringing the outdoors in, like, just have, like, a room in the middle of your house where it's just name it.
It's just well, that's while in neon lights.
That's one thing to have plants, and it's like human in there and whatever, but there's like a fake thunderstorm saying you're supposed to be having sex in the fucking room.
Yes, why else would you have, like disco lighting?
And like, there's definitely like a Roman statue that's urinating water.
Yeah, I know.
It sounds like a fuck room to make.
It's only as big as a house.
Chris.
All has all rooms of fuck rooms thing.
This one seems tailored to that cause.
Yeah, Okay.
Well, yeah, of course, man.
Why not?
Right, I guess.
Come on.
Why not?
But wouldn't you fuck with the wind on you back in your old house?
Sounds fun point.
He's got a snooty neighbor.
Comes to nothing.
One of the many things you just drop this music.
Oh, the building doesn't allow pets, But here I have this huge fucking horse.
The whole thing there is like, if you're setting up this neighbor who's like, Hey, this this apartment building doesn't allow pad.
He's like, he's like, they're they're like a yuppie scumbag.
Yeah, when essential.
Then something in that movie has to be about the horse getting discovered and they get kicked out of the apartment like this dude gets like shit in his groceries or something worse than that spot on the floor.
Yeah, he needs to have, like, a righteous gag against this where he does have one little later, we'll get get flustered by a duck.
It's nothing big what they do.
There's like and so I think it's here.
There's a great montage to what is that replacement song?
It's like the It's the hanging out montage where they should be doing cocaine.
And it's that replacement song That's like shooting dirty pool, telling duty, shooting, dirty pool.
It's such a good song.
And I was like, This isn't for this movie.
That's it.
I need John Candy Fact I blues music, but I think this is it.
It's a mix up.
Its fat guy John Candy music mixed with, like, cool New a V Bobcat music.
It's That's where the Beastie Boys come from.
Probably, Yeah, you're right.
If you get that hit Bobcat audience that's true.
And so, like this montages them, drinking a lot of soda, watching a lot of TV there, watching that mutant aunt movie them.
We'll go back one.
Like if you said cable people look.
Whoa, Shit, You've got cable.
Yeah.
You know what this movie reminded me of?
The man the innocent days where television stations had the sign off.
No.
Yeah.
Where is just the shot of the flag?
I mean, it's the most like, bullshit American thing of all time, but it's like the shot of the flag, the flag, we're playing the national anthem and then a TV station would just go to bed or well, now it's just like, you know, like things about like a little steel enclosures.
You could buy a writer.
I bought my steel building and I love it.
It's the magic bullets.
Now they just play the Zapruder film.
Why would I want to order one?
That's got to be public domain, though you could air that.
Just give CNN arrest yet.
What?
You know why not?
Right?
Just aired on a loop for a few hours in the morning.
They aired it on live on television in the 19 sixties.
Kids could see it.
Why not today?
I just hate.
It's like you'll notice on a television show.
Or a television station like MSNBC does this.
When they run out of shows, they just start repeating the last four hours of shows.
Just turn it off, run the support of him, or do like a a July 4th holiday, You know, to compete with a Twilight Zone marathon.
Yeah, it is approved, Orville Marathon Totally.
Or buy it.
Ken Burns, Doc.
For the love of God and run it.
Yeah, just put that lined up all your You're helping people go to sleep on fucking 2 a.m.
until, like, you know 8 38 30 p up the next day that civil liberties Eric baseball the entirety.
Why not Ken Burns the blues?
May I?
May I change the subject to something very important?
I really do need to tip my hat to whoever was in charge of the horse.
Cock blocking.
Yes.
I think this guy pulled in eyes wide shut on this thing.
This was magnificent.
Is I didn't even think about was Mr until he starts talking about Yes.
Well, thankfully, not a lot of horse cock talk in this room.
Is it possible that they just used the lady horse on?
John Candy is doing the voice because listen, that's like if it's not, I mean, that's tough.
You're not digitally removing anything.
At one point, Bobcat goes to a yuppie party that's going on upstairs to try and then weird quote unquote spinster that, like it's Alexei, every character you owe a man anchovy and I almost vomited all over my not like anchovies.
But I think that was it.
I think I'm done.
She was like, Oh, she comes into his house.
Oh, while you got a horse.
And if the guy was a fucking horse again and then, like, well, he's pretending to horse and pretending to be a statue.
Oh, it's anatomically correct.
That's right, I think, to the all 83 minutes of this movie.
That's the only horse dick joke.
Thank God.
Thank God for that.
Great.
It's a great film, but there's also just, like, random fucking sex shit all over this.
Oh, yeah, Like when in in?
Not to bring us too much back, but like when they are with the horse parents, Um, part of the three.
Like Burgess Meredith translates a question from the mother and her question.
Right.
Bobcat is what it's like to have sex with somebody facing them.
Yeah.
Why would you even bring that up?
Forces are here.
Thes kids love candy.
You know what I mean?
Like the 1988 was Camp Candy out there.
What the hell's camp?
What?
I also coming?
What?
Coming soon to an animation dame.
Damnation near you.
Ok, so it's a cartoon cartoon with John Candy ran a summer camp for care.

He was like the leader of this little troop of candles.
It was like towards the end, you know, like is a wagons east JFK.
I'll go to this this little recording studio and make a summer camp.
Tell me you're watching this cartoon in 1994.
Yeah, something that Something that Yeah.
I can't believe it.
It was wholesome.
And what is it?
It's very wholesome.

How old's his son?
He's like, you know, when he's probably like, Yeah, like in his late teens, he looks like a very handsome young Jason Alexander.
Sounds like, um, like a raping Julia Roberts.
Jason Alexander.
What was that?
What pretty woman I get my money's worth running the world.
Oh, you will forget that Jason Alexander Breeland like a hungry pig.
Does he like, Oh, this is the funny movie with the jewel case like No, no, no.
It's the movie where Jason Alexander really grossly tries to have aggressive rape sex with fucking yeah, Julia Roberts.
Yuck!
Yeah, well, it's what's what's bad about this show?
Aside from everything is, there's a lot of like cause it's all about The Sun's trying to be an actor.
Oh, come on, That is that right?
And he's going.
He's going to Jason Alexander Frilly career advice and stuff.
And there's a lot of like were mentioned in Seinfeld.
I'm like, But, you know, we just call it like the show.
So there's nothing on Dunstan checks?
Not yet.
I only watched, like, four episodes of it.
All right, First things first, Cody is you wanna accidentally be on the greatest sitcom of all time and if he's fantastic on the show.
But he could have easily done any other pilot.
You know what I mean?
Like a bottle.
But yet, no, it's terrible.
Um, so the shit's creek, the horse eyes like now we're doing like bad roommates gags in the middle of this moving on, and all of a sudden the dog shows up and it's like run.
I'm a dog from New Haven, the dogs barking.
We have subtitles and is that can I party with you and the thing about those horses?
This one is kind of sad, like whose wants, like somebody to hang out with his constant calling Bobcat Goldthwait at the office like Hey, man, what do you want to do tonight?
He's like, I gotta work and Euro horse.
And then it's like a horse.
Sadly, hanging up a phone horse has anxiety.
Doesn't really weird.
Fucking tragic.
It's really fucking strange.
And like now he lets this fucking dog in.
But this is what sucks.
There's birds.
I mean, it gets why it turns into a basically the dogs like an orgy.
It Jack Hanna's house.
That would've been a fucking fun night for Johnny Carson.
Just come over.
I feel like I know what I'm going home.
So, Jack Hanna, Uh, all right.
I have to do 100 years in baboon hell and then another 100 years.

What this needs to be, though, And I'm sorry.
This is ah, horse voiced by John ever loving candy.
This needs to be a big fat party animal.
Yeah, this is the saddest horse, and film is here.
He's kind of just like he's like one of those kids.
That is kind of like, Oh, a party just breaks out at their house and they don't want to have totally loses control.
And it's known a writer and girl interrupted.
Horace interrupted.
I like this.
Don't cut me off again.
Whores.
It directed like it's really it's like he is a psychological condition you don't like.
It takes up the whole fucking movie.
And this whole this whole menagerie fucking takes advantage of it.
Yeah, All these animals show up Another dog, a bunch of different birds and all sorts of stuff start piling in and destroyed.
They destroy Bobcats house.
Bobcat comes in.
I can't believe it.
This is where fight for your right to party is playing by.
Oh, yeah.
The Beastie Boys were just like you will sign a check.
What's this called?
Hot to trot out.
What's it about?
I don't care.
This is like we don't really care about this.
Yeah, that's my question is because, as we know, the Star Trek universe revolves around Beastie boys so hot to trot probably survived.
Right?
Kirk's favorite movie Growing up in Iowa, I think it's like the only thing that's left to the Criterion collections.
It's just everyone in their house has a glass case with, like, a 12 k disk file of Try it on it, Jim, you've got to stop watching.
Hot to trot way.
We've got to get out of here.
Ah, lonely horses.
Illogical Captain.
Horses are very social animals.
My brother Sai Bach rode a horse with a horn on it once a comical farce, you green blooded broken your watch it and you laugh.
What's to understand, Captain?
Why isn't this horse a big, fat party animal?
Well, okay, it's not perfect spot, but give it a shot, which, like Mr Ed on cocaine, you green blooded monster.
It took me four times tow.
Watch a gym.
I didn't understand it.
How much ever done cocaine with a horse, Thomas?
Simple country doctor.
So, like bobcats luck with these stocks eventually starts running out.
What with him taking advice?
Rewards Horse is like, Oh, he brings the horse oats and the horses eats oats.
And he's like, this is the best parents in the world.
This company is gonna be huge.
So he invests heavily in this company the next day at the Indio Oats, Indio oats.
But apparently ah, Dabney Coleman gets a stock tip that the things under FDA investigation, this is my favorite seeing that we need to talk about.
So the horse and we don't know why the horse loved it so much.
Oh, no.
The horsemen be sick.
The horse called the horse named Don, by the way.
Calls up Bobcat is like, you got to sell that stock.
Uh, it made me sick.
And he's calling him from the toilet, and the horse has diarrhea in your house.
Are you kidding?
You have to burn that thing down.
You know what?
You just you go outside your house.
Six like planks of wood.
You hammer them all to the door, and then you scribble abandoned dumb, and yet joey pants to help you burn it.
You have to or like, looks like a horse.
That diary.
I'm gonna put it to the fucking ground.
The horses in there, right?
Okay, good.
We'll clean up, Bobcat.
Unless the horse is flushing every 12 seconds.
That thing will stink forever.
That's diarrhea.
Overflow ab ab kit.
This is his super, um, you remember in Ghostbusters to when the slime is all over the outside of the museum.
That's your apartment as of this moment, encased in four Styria warship.
You know what?
You could call Ghostbusters, do a fucking river shit.
But like everyone just close the Ghostbusters, close your eyes and imagine a really nice bathroom.
You know, everywhere.
You know what I mean?
Like a nice like, you know, it's theeighties.
So there's a gray and pink painting somewhere.
Cocaine on the sink and a 600 pound horse hovering around, not over around a human toilet is how could it get it, Get it?
Really?
I don't think it would even fit.
I think it's going directly into the and he even says at one point you gotta close that.
You gotta close this toilet seat after you use it.
Bobcat Goldthwait.
So is this horse like sitting on the toilet?
See?
No, I think this horse is like standing near something and hoping for the best.
Hoping his ass is the tub way and not possible.
I shit the tub.
Actually.
Tub Do it.
Yeah, but like, the thing's gonna overflow or if it's bad oats, diarrhea, things gonna overflow this shit on the bed and then just throw it all out if he's a millionaire And this is a tip Bobcat, if your horse friend calls you from your bathroom and he say, says he has diarrhea, don't come home.
Never come home.
Now Just don't start a new life.
It's okay.
That's what a security deposit is for.
If you get money like that, just walk away.
Whatever was in that God, it's all those other animals the ducks and the pigs.
They'll destroy all suffocated to death.
There's no air left, a stain league.
Dude, you can't get through that.
No way, dude, That's that's why horses Aaron open air animal for horseshit purposes.
So only the shipping the space is an issue, but it's mainly the shit.
Exactly.
There's a bit where Bobcat is on a look.
So, basically like Dabney Coleman locks Bobcat in the bathroom, right?
So he can't sell his shares.
So he runs out of money.
Bobcat does this bit where he walks on a ledge.
One of the only things I remember about this movie is this scene Where you just kind of what?
Fiddling around in alleged?
Yeah, he's fallen off.
There's a pigeon that's fucking with him.
Yeah, It's a perfect strangers gag you for ever Bobcat.
Ever guest star on perfect strangers because I feel like that's a perfect match.
I feel like he must have.
You know what?
They'll probably not these duties for it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is a time of Bobcat.
Could do fucking 12 perfect strangers.
I think he had a comedy special.
Bobcat Goldthwait.
Too big for TV.
He knew Steve Gutenberg.
That's yes.
That just wear my vote.
Yeah.
Why don't you let that sink isn't funny?
Um uh, that you as a kid, I thought that's how Bobcat Goldthwait just talked.
Like Oh, sure, that's that's how that guy talks.
It was still weird.
I mean, when this one that whenever that doc came out, that he did with Barry Crimmins, like, two years ago, I got to do a Q and A with the two of them.
And even and I knew then, like I'd heard him since then, speak, you know, but the meeting him in person, I was like, Oh, he's going to do the thing.
And he was just, like, the nicest chilis dude.
And he's still fucking hilarious.
But he was just being a guy.
And I was like, Aren't you gonna burn all over the place?
Oh, no, because you're a human being that character.
Are you nervous about something?
No.
Yeah.
Totally.
Shouldn't you be like pulling your hair out of your head?
No, I will say.
And this is It's odd.
D'oh!
Compliment police at me.
But Police academy, it was good.
He's great.
Ghost move.
Police academy, too.
By the way, it is not in the 1st 1 I think John is a carpetbagger to the police academy, and I didn't know it was earliest too, so that I think it's just 234 people came in on the later.
Yeah, I don't think he's I don't think not a single police academy movies using what the fuck is wrong with you?
Seriously, get your head exam.
Well, they're all stay tuned.
Oh, my eye on the docket.
Eric, I got the four pack DVD.
I know you will.
The four pack that ain't all of them blew.
It was something that is certainly enough of its don't need city under siege.
I don't need mission to Moscow with Fucking Lloyd Braun.
Well, which Which one is Police Academy?
Rampant homophobia.
Which one is that all of that Simon assignment.
Miami Beach, which is actually the the Matt McCoy wanted.
He asked me that.
Lloyd Braun.
Oh, right.
Those movies are vitriolically homophobe.
Oh, yeah, you know what?
You had to fight against the agenda.
Speaking of which, this movie, John Candy says the F word.
And I'm not talking about old fucks time.
No, it's weird.
He goes to a state of before.
What happens with Bobcat like gets ousted from the company because right that loses everything.
Before that happens, he goes to visit Dabney Coleman's other horse at a stable.
For some reason, I think it's kind of to get laid because he's kind of like our hey baby and he's into that other horse that Dabney Coleman's horses gave something.
Or others girlfriend.
Yes, satin doll satin doll?
No, no, But this is other horse that eyes like a thoroughbred.
The price something or other, and it's really weird.
It's just John Candy as a horse looking at another horse and under his breath muttering the F bomb.
And it's a sick cheese.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, what if you're gonna do it?
Why bury it?
It's just like like you're so much more hateful.
Do you think that was the mentality of Eddie Murphy?
And wrong?
That's a problem with Eddie Murphy.
Yeah.
It wasn't like he just said it and like, this was like, I had to go back as I was like, what did he Even so I think I know why.
You know why that is?
Because I bet you John Candy had a hard time saying that line.
Why put it in this?
So that's my boy.
Fucking hilarious.
Yeah.
Do you think that was in the Elliott Gould version as well?
No.
I want Elliot Gould saying that word.
I think that he's got a little too much class for that.
You just called him a Schranz.
It just means Dick.
It's fine.
No, I Yeah.
You know, you're not wrong.
Ah, where were we?
Oh, so he loses everything.
Him and the horse hit the road.
And then we have a scene where, like, love, Virginia Mats is like on his side way went on a date.
At one point they go on a date like and she's there.
He doesn't know how to eat Linguini.
He doesn't even know how to say it.
How is she at all Attractive house?
But, like how?
Like you're living under Dabney Coleman's roof for years?
How do you not?
Because there's a There's a scene where he gets kicked out house at one point, but it's like, How does he not have any of that refinement?
It's a slobs.
We're snobs thing, but it doesn't make sense because he's growing up as a snob.
What year?
Well, but it's also It's stated, though, that Dabney Coleman is his step dad.
And I think it's a Henry's.
This roof.
That's right.
I think it's a single.
He's like, I don't give a fuck about this person.
I'm gonna treat you, learn how to say Linguini.
At least you think you'd pick something up.
I think he says, like Lynn Ginny's or something, because he's like it's just like I'm sorry.
It's just like spaghetti, and that's the thing is like Here you are.
You're 1988 Virginia.
Mads.
Hello.
You fucking 2016 Virginia meds.
And you're having dinner with a guy that looks like a 1988 Bob Goldthwait.
Mullet, be mill.
It'd as all get out tied back in a ponytail because you're definitely at a fancy restaurant in this scene.
And he can't even say Linguini.
And he has the bobcat voice.
You're like, Dude, um, you know what it is that she's just horny is how no, this date was actually set up his corporate espionage.
Oh, that's right.
You're right.
I don't have anyone to know how he was getting the stock.
Yes, but her heart is melted all the same.
I mean, when you look into those eyes, I just want to take care of him.
Well, it's like a puppy dog that got hit by a car.
Oh, you don't even know what a J.
Green.
So the scheme is to get the money back, and this is the problem.
The movie should end with some sort of stock thing, right?
It's a stockbroker movie and a Wall Street thriller.
It should end like trading places.
You know what I mean?
Like, you know, buy orange juice.
Didn't like Michael clean.
Oh, my God.
Yes, it goes up to three humans on the hill.
I like that.
But I said We end with a horse race because yes.
Oh, if if if he bit wins, the big horse race will have enough money for something and like he says that he could win the race.
But using psychological tactics, Well, that's and that's John Candy's just like shit talking.
All these other boys sing his competition.
Freddy, A bobcat has to end up being the jockey, right?
Let's just get into the race this year.
Well, the one thing I want to get to before that it's the night before.
He's having like, a panic attack.
How am I gonna win this way?
Races.
John Candy.
The most disturbing thing I've ever seen is this fly puppet that is over.
My puppet.
Voiced by Burgess Meredith is a living night, the reincarnation of his dead.
Rather, there's no horse with the horse Dad like dies at some point.
It's a nothing has a horse mouth the little lips.
It's got lips.
It's so gross.
You know what's fucked up is in the end credits.
The person who created this fly puppet is credited I want.
I want Alan Smithee that shit that's just to find him.
It's okay, Look, put it out there and let people find it.
Is the blacklist.
Burn his house down because I'm glad you, because that is it's disgusting.
But like there's the other thing, which is when Oh, God, um Don gets a forth six puppet A doll like you and this is just another one.
That's fucking sex things in this movie that's right, like the horse has guarded Omo!
It's a sexy Lawrence you could buy.
That's a weird like that.
There's kind of this funny banter with There's like a housekeeper that Bobcat hires and like, she's got some funny banter where she's like vacuuming.
And she asked the horse like stick his leg up so she can vacuum and whatnot.
So this this boxes delivered for this horse, and she signs for it and opens it, and this thing just blows itself up.
And she's like, Oh, you you've ordered a sex doll that's shaped like a huge oars, a huge pink oars.
Yeah, no, it's weird.
A grown situation.
But the weird thing is, so you're Bobcat is the day the race bobcat goads Dabney Coleman and debating all of his horses against his one horse Because you're not gonna win.
Yeah, well, he pulls them look fly ticket Shit.
We're saying the word chicken shit got in the eighties were saying, Gigio, your karma took it.
And so great, how damn it gets all fucking pissed off about it also, though, like, I'm fairly certain you can't just sign.
Ah, horse up for, ah, horse race.
It's not a fucking boxcar Derby.
You think that'll be booked?
Yeah, there's not just open slots where you can get your fucking horse.
And it's not a sign up sheet way of the Burgess Meredith fly thing.
Like he actually down the horse, actually, reference like I need a pep talk.
Like, yes, Like the old man from Rocky who is literally your father.
Yeah, you'd be weird.
And he actually did bronchi references in this.
Like I got a You gotta go.
Yeah, you gotta be Italian.
But the funny thing is, Burgess Burgess never saw this movie, so he doesn't know you.
Burgess Meredith isn't heaven.
That's the only man that everyone you know, he had the battle.
Ah, horse.
To get in there.
And you know what, Burgess?
Meredith beat the fucking shit out of that horse.
Believe it, old ass.
100 year old Buddhist, married with a cane and fucking wallop.
No pure, pure fistfight.
Do you?
Right out.
Remember, I was gonna ask.
It was something about Burgess Meredith to be in a sweet Nothing about him.
Do you think he went to his grave without seeing this movie?
Is that did he see Rocky one Easy, Rocky, to watch his own death scene.
Yeah, he dies in Rocky.
Three friends.
Was it Rocky three.
Do you think he watches on death scene in that, I'm sure.
How about the grumpy old men movies?
Oh, right.
We please.
Dad just had fun on those and just didn't want those movies.
They're annoying.
They die.
And he died in the 2nd 1 Yes.
Yeah, Well, British Bird had, like, a death tour, Which is kind of a weird thing when you're an older actor.
Were like every movie here in you die of old age.
Well, that sucks.
Walter Matthau.
I'm 100 years old and grumpier old men, and somehow my father just died.
I don't know.
I actually, baby said, I don't know how I mean little birds.
I remember a little birdie like to be bounced on my knee, too.
I like this idea of, like, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith as like a little baby.
I don't know, like a benjamin button.
There was an old men, but their babies, they get into all types of, like, scrapes and stuff.
Oh, no.
I shit my pants again, baby.
Walter Matthau.
Good.
Indeed s o old man.
40 c C's of powder here.
It's like that movie the boss baby.
Fucking cute.
So Bob Goldthwait is the tallest jockey of all time.
So, like, Yeah, well, this horse is not a run.
Second of all, Bobcat Goldthwait is like 200 pounds is on the fucking back of his whores.
Yeah.
Huh.
So they go on, he's gonna use psychological tactic.
The 1st 1 is hypnosis.
Takes this horse out.
Bela Lugosi?
Yeah.
It's kind of weird.
The weird thing is, so what he does is and not to spoil it.
He goes into every horse.
He says something humorous on the horse veers off the course.
It stops racing.
There's no Mafia, would have a huge problem with this hotel Mafia had money on some horse, and then they're like, you always do.
They do at the fix was in on fucking Don.
The horns.
Yep.
All it takes is one Mafia horse.
I have to think they don't need to like having all the horses.
No.
It's like we have money in that one horse and you put it to sleep with hypnosis.
But you are with 600 tickets.
The hot to trot, please.
Oh, you got Denny Spaghetti.
Don't Inspector for Should have made those dude one of one of the horses he Sykes out.
He is a horse for my guest, Mexico.
Oh, right.
And there's a whole big like there's immigration at the finish line.
Runs away like it's makes a bee line.
We do also.
I mean, the three jokes, the two jokes.
You can make it a horse movie.
One is the mystery joke, and the other is the glue factory, which the glue factory joke.
You can't have 1/3 act glue factory joking.
Ah, horse move Their strength, the cinematic restrained.
Technically, that's what it's a perfect food because the because Dabney Coleman threatened dog food.
Yeah, dog your dog.
Your dog meat?
Yes.
All right.
One of the sex that two horses.
Oh, yeah.
The guy from Elmer's Glue is at the finish line.
He's going to give it, you know?
And then they go Bird, it's a bunch of startled the horses.
Oh, man, Elmer from Elmer's Glue, That guy's horse healthy.
I mean, like the Elmer was a cow.
But no, the guy must be named after John Elmer of Elvis Glue.
Elmer's used to go up, used to do it his coward.
He would just go into horse yards and just with the huge mallet and take one out one.
But gloom up, man.
That's how Elmer Bought made it was.
It was in between his clan built his empire on bludgeoned horses.
Your sense to 1,000,000,000 years of horse hell, Give him the glue, boys.
Oh, yeah, totally.
It's like I'm selling the carbon.
Oh, it's first of all, it's ah, 100,000 years of horses using Elmer's glue to rip your pew bears off.
So it's more like the sigh like that.
So whatever he wins this horse race somehow because the horse has, like, fucked up teeth that stick out and, like the teeth crossed the finish line first.
That's a gag photo finish, his teeth sticking out.
And then because he won the race, he gets to get his teeth capped.
The workers.
The horse was self conscious about us.
This'll always had a lot of mint.
He doesn't like his teeth, you know, like the beings.
The social anxiety just don't need a weak horse.
I don't need a week.
John.
Candy period?
No, John Candy was a confident man, at least on camera.
I didn't know him personally.
Every battle demons.
I'm sure he did.
I'm sure it was just put on while talking on screen men.
This is a dude who used his x x x l pants to put up a flagpole in winter regatta contest.
He had a sense of humor.
Charity for business, the characters.
Anyway, this horse needed to be a big, fat party.
And I'm not not eaten soda.
He needed re fuckin smoking cigarettes.
Drinking beer out of a straw that I'm putting.
He fills the fish bowl, fill it full of beers, you know, definitely old style.
You know what I mean?
He's drinking.
Restored Khoury.
Okay, I could use.
Oh, sure.
Cars, horse karaoke.
James Corden.
Okay, Right.
He could play the horse way.
Get the horse dentist at the end of the movie played by Gilbert Gottfried.
Right?
And we get weird fucking mouth cam.
This is disgusting.
It's the most disgusting thing.
It's a horse stated puppeteer.
I guarantee you, it's a little shovel horse.
Yeah, but it's weird.
It's, ah, horses.
You're inside a horse's mouth.
Your horses asked What's disgusting?
You know, a lot of people have been in horse's mouth.
I don't worry about it.
I better horses.
Bounds.
It took us a guard right out of my mouth.
I went back inside the car.
One day a horse crossed me.
I took one part of his job and I split it.
A mobile.
Yeah, Mohammed horse Alan.
I'm being slowly digested inside of a horse, and I just looked at a horse's mouth and I want her out of the house.
That's a house gave, Dude, you are forever stuck inside a horse's mouth, looking out at Gilbert Godfried in 1988.
That's a horror.
Ah, horrible place.
I wanna be the ends with a dead body that's all, folks.
Well, whatever, because it was the tone of this movie, much like off beat, is kind of like a cartoon.
Yes, it's just a fun little thing.
Let's not get too serious about it, Chris Cab.
But what?
Well, I mean, there's no there's no ending to any of the human characters.
The last you see of them, they're all sitting in a waiting room reading magazine.
But you know that they're together because Virginia Madsen is now both wearing a Hawaiian shirt with Bobcat Goldthwait.
Oh, I didn't even know a girl.
Yes, that's gross.
She also has one point.
Quit her job I've discussed about Dabney Coleman.
Oh, if you found out about the nefarious, just totally noticed his teeth for the 1st 0 I can't work with this.
We have the horse doesn't be ba dee ba dee.
That's all, folks and credits Yes, your credits.
Cut to fact that John Candy music again.
Thank God.
Yet that's how you know this movie's over.
It sounds like the beginning of Roseanne.
Oh man.
And she's like taking all the chips.
Poker.
Jim's.
Well, it depends upon which seasons you're watching.
Sometimes they're playing cards sometimes reading Chinese food.
Any suits?
What I remember.
Yeah, it was different.
The Conner family did different things.
Yet for how many seasons?
A lot.
Too many.
I think there's like nine seasons.
Yeah, that's it.
Went on forever and fucking stunk after a while on bats have to try what anybody recommended.
I would not.
I've hit it again Like like 25 years.
At least I've hated this movie.
I'll continue to hate this movie for longer.
There's just nothing here for me personally.
Big thumbs up.
I recommend this.
Definitely seeing is believing, as in, you're seeing an uproarious comedy.
I would say that's like the only defense to see it is is if you absolutely need to see a horse movie.
You thio.
Sometimes you need to see a horse movie, Man, I got I got the teacher said for homework.
I got to see a horse movie by five morning.
I mean, that's like I otherwise ah, hard no, uh, this movie board the But Jesus, that's insane.
It's 83 minutes long, and it's got a toast forever for me to cling on to this.
It was a good gallop by real quick it did not.
For May, it felt like eternity.
I am.
The Klingons were here.
They wanna watch Hot to trot.
But again Yes.
If you are absolutely in need of a horse movie, it does give you that kick Hashtag We want hot to trot.
Better break out the Rambla nail.
Things could get dicey.
I'm totally recommending this movie I'd never seen before.
It's fucking stupid.
It's entertaining.
It was a quick 83 minutes for me.
I couldn't believe it was over with.
I was like, Oh, well, the Porky pig means it's over.
That's something I was actually confused too, because Gilbert shows up.
And I was like, Oh, here's Gilbert cool.
And then the movie was over with, which was kind of shocked for like, one minute.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Was this like before he was Gilbert e mean that no, on SNL by now.
Forever lanes 1990.
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You around time movies.
I mean, I just don't think he, like, had a person until problem child problem get was late seventies.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, I don't know.
I was totally fine with it.
It's fucking stupid.
I mean, I see What you're saying about like the Bobcat persona is not something that carries the movie.
But thank God there was a talking horse voiced by a comedy legend.
Yeah, I thought it was fun.
It's dummy shit.
You're right.
You're right, you're right.
But I had fun with it.
I grew up with it.
It's just stupid.
Dumb is horseshit.
That's hot to trot from 1988 Directed by Michael Dinner.
