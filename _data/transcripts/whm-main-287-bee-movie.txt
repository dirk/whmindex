Smith.
So it wouldn't be king about What the fuck are you talking?
Not saying?
Speak.
Musing?
Be king speaking.
No, that one doesn't work.
Yeah, I don't know.
It's a tough one.
Overruled.
Don't we deal with all of them?
Isn't that like what you were looking?
Everything?
Yeah, that's man.
This movie.
Not only does it suck because it sucks, don't Don't worry, It sucks.
It's also fucking weird and creepy, and it also blows.
It does suck.
It does indeed blow a cz.
Wayne Campbell would might say it blows chunks.
Perhaps.
I do want to clear the air here because everyone's gonna buy.
Those guys were only doing it because it's an Internet sensation.
Incorrect.
Incorrect Speaking.
The listener request A month in November of 2014 I was soliciting Steve Select for for movies.
Right, Right.
I remember.
This was the animated one.
This was There was one that was That was the hand that rocks the cradle that was called in The other one was B movie.
Nobody called it.
There you go.
I saw this movie that creep me out.
It made it made my spine tingle Spine was tingling.
I say this is the first time I saw it.
Oh, I'd never seen the book I had never seen before.
It looks like fucking garbage.
I was also a beaver's virgin.
Be urgent.
No, doesn't work, Dammit, Listen, the thing about well, actually you don't always have to go be a tough one point in this movie that you say, Oh, we're very proud of you.
And I'm like, What now?
It's just bad valley.
That's Kara Dupin.
How is there not a show me the honey, you know?
Are you sure they didn't?
Dogo You go and take a shit at some point there in the movies, Do you know how do you know Chris Cabin?
How I am 100% confident that they don't do show Be the honey honey in this in this movie, because I'm not fucking swinging from my bathroom ceiling, OK, good point, but it would have been a test Sweets, man.
Now we're just expanding the beep.
Um, so that's in tooth wounded Seinfeld and 99 98 to 98.
Society felt like kind of ended.
It ended right around when that green day song came out.
Yeah, that song.
That was your life.
Good riddance.
Yes, they were playing that over Seinfeld, and they did it on the clip show the hour long clip show.
And they're all like, take That always kind of makes me misty, man.
I was If no one else is going to say it, man, I've fucking cried during that.
You're, like crying, like watching dogs get kicked butt, like, you know, just like that gold a song playing.
And let me tell you before every show fucking sporting event, whatever the hell else dead person Monty's ruin that song.
I did kind of like that Green Day song.
I did, but I just thought that was discussed is really cheap.
I mean, and, like, I'd be just like dogs getting kicked the same level, but sure, and at this point, I just I only think of like I can't think of the good times because I just think.
But Steve Bannon counting his money.
Yo, that's true.
Yeah, that that does sour that show.
Yeah, like just a tad.
But it doesn't stop me from one.
Yeah, you're still doing it.
But there's other ways to fight Nazis.
So So insightful.
Went away.
And, like, he kind of had this air of mystery for a couple of years, right?
I mean, like, nobody knew what he knew.
He didn't come back with a new show.
He wouldn't like pop on anything star in anything latched onto his girlfriend, though, didn't they?
When he had a girl when he had a consistent girlfriend.
Yet, like, took over all the fucking gossip bullshit.
Well, she was 19 years old at the time.
So?
So it was the direct opposite of the TV show where the women were so forgettable that couldn't be mentioned.
More than one episode.
I think you can count on one hand the amount of women that, like, made it more than one episode of him.
Yeah, it's tough.
Oh, Cher's unveils a new project garrison from New Project to project our side order.
And it's a movie about a B that wants to have sex with a lady.
This this was it.
Yeah, this was This was the one.
But the only thing before that the wasn't there.
The I'm telling you for the last time, the comedy special before the documentary that he made Oh, and then comedian Oh, that's right.
And comedian, I thought was like, Fine.
I mean, it's one of those things.
It's kind of like that movie The aristocrats like you can kind of just watch it once and you live with you and then you'll go to your grave never watching it a second time, which is totally fine.
That's the way comedian was.
I saw it in theaters.
Is fine.
That's the end of it on then.
Yeah, I'm telling you, for the last time, which was, like, good enough like no Frank Oz?
No.
Like James Brooks, maybe.
What the hell you talking about?
Ah, project.
If you're fucking Jerry Seinfeld and you're looking for your first project out of the Gate of Rio movie with a real big comedy to Alexander Payne because I'm not a real actor and he's even, but somebody's got it.
I mean, like, somebody's gotta put him in something I mean, if what's his face?
Could get a good performance out of Matthew Lillard.
Like, made sure the pain.
Yeah, yeah, but like, Oh, no, my dad is dying.
Oh, my God.
My wife's cheating on they all.
My kids hate me.
Like what else could be what situations going find himself?
I'm Hawaiian royalty, working light.
And what's the deal with my Hawaiian heritage?
Why's my brother Beau Bridges?
I'm walking around with Bruce turns man, That's the movie I want to start.
And it's just called walking around with Bruce Dern.
Yeah.
You want to get lunch?
You want to get lunch?
Yeah.
We better walk there though, right?
But now we're gonna have a good sit.
Gonna eat a sandwich is we're not going to rush it.
So I mean, like, at this point, ants had come out and bugs left way.
All thought we were done with animated bug movie.
Yeah, we're going to our tents and animated movies.
Steve, they were bugging me out that Jerry Seinfeld bugging out.
Why not?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He could be eyes actually thinking of the spike league.
Does anyone remember the John Leguizamo?
I don't know.
I gave of the French pronunciation of the Sean John Leguizamo.
Uh, sketch.
Uh, that was on Fox, like 19 seconds.
Oh, wait, isn't his commercial it's called House of Bug?
Yes, Early to mid nineties.
Yeah, you better believe he had a lot of wigs.
That is terrifying.
You know, that's got the cable company commercial that your references, That's what.
House of buggin.
Waas.
You're right, Eric.
Spit, gargle ground Just It's just not for the past on loop.
Oh, yikes.
Who is Mama?
That's a movie.
So what's not a movie is B movie.
It's Yeah, it is B A.
Really, you know, everyone's doing human movies will do be yes.
Well, apparently, as the rumor goes, Um, Steven Spielberg was like talking with Seinfeld and Seinfeld jokingly was like making up this idea for a movie.
And Spielberg was like, No, it's a good idea.
That's why DreamWorks is putting this movie out.
Yeah, because they're buddies, I guess.
Like Spielberg learned how to take a joke.
Funny, Joel Advice Never listen to Steven Spielberg.
It's unbelievable.
He was gonna go.
The villain and minority report, I guess, is that speaking of DreamWorks, even the max one side up.
They they have a special B movie logo Because this movie is gonna be such a hit.
Yeah.
Seven B movies.
Oh, yeah.
A box set.
It's Shrek all over even months.
Track is trash.
Tracker is total trash.
This is like, I mean in the animations.
This wasn't God.
It looks So this is a better movie than any Shrek movie?
No, 100%.
Even the first.
Yeah, Yeah, I think you're I think it's, like, dead.
Even I feel like people are gonna disagree with me.
But, you know, you know, the ghost of Chris Farley is happy because finally, someone's talking shit about track way peace now that killed him.
Like what happened to Chris?
Chris Farley was Shrek.
He recorded the whole thing on them like your died.
And Mike Myers?
Well, now fucking Mike Myers is going to be mysteriously killed in Eric.
Cisco is going to jail.
No, no, no, no.
I'm gonna I'm gonna slide right into that Shrek revival Now I'm the voice of ugly monster.
There's not Wait, no, that's true in real life, Charming, ugly month making animated documentary over there.
Well, it's just like, you know, Stryker's trash.
Because not only do we have you got, like, there's like Shrek Christmas.
Yeah, there's a bunch of shooting.
You serious?
There's a bunch of shitty like Halloween Easter special.
Fucking kidding.
No.
All right was how many theatrical two or 333 or four?
War?
Least Fuck was the fourth thought about?
Maybe somebody's gonna have a baby.
I have a B B.
It's a gnarly man.
It's all about the birthing process, the miracle of life over birds, the miracle of Shrek.
And they're like wet animal Having sex?
No.
Do you think what happens?
I think the gag right.
It's kind of like a naked gun gag, right?
Because the Shrek's wife gives birth right then what happens is they look at it and it kind of looks like Shrek.
But it also has like a donkey tail on the donkey just goes just like runs out of the hospital.
The Shrek Hospital.
That's that's a show that the canceled Trek Hospital on I lost another one on the table district, killing people.
The three little pigs of Diaby is it's like house accessory misdiagnosis, everyone.
That's a fun show.
So B movie is a movie that we're talking about.
Seinfeld stars as Barry Bee Benson, who I guess is is he's mostly in those like twenties or what?
What?
He's graduating college at the start of the movie.
Yes, yeah, so yeah, yeah.
And the weird thing is, this movie does this weird thing.
We're like it's like, Oh, it's funny, cause bugs live short lives.
So he's like, Oh, yeah, last week.
You know, one day I was in grade school.
The other day I was in high school that I took a gap year, and now I'm graduating.
College had been four days, but then the rest of the movie takes place over like, six weeks, and that would be dead totally.
This baby would have expired.
Also, this movie this'll movie needs to take a fucking chance and kill Cem Bey's.
How about it really does.
Well, they're talking about death the whole fucking time estan dance.
Stop dancing around.
There's some black comedy which I appreciate, you know, there's like they're talking about deadbeat black and yellow.
Come.
Oh, Bravo.
So, uh, he graduates high school.
Hey, it's picked up by his buddy Adam, who's played by Matthew Broderick.
Know another noted a 20 year old actor.
We had, you know, hot tea.
Yep, they're both exist on it.
They're excited.
They're they're going to graduation.
And here's my first question.
Why do bees have cars?
Why do you think at some point the answer.
That's what we'll do.
You?
What do you have?
Cause what?
You just walked around.
Why don't you go fuck yourself talking B.
This is a stupid movie with a lot of bees.
Have cars?
Why do bees drink coffee?
What?
Toby's hang out with comedians in cars, getting It's just old fucking Jerry Seinfeld's like stuff he likes.
Yes, exactly.
Stuff I like.
Love, Superman.
These lovers speak eyes.
There's an old man with the New York Mets hat on.
There definitely is a closet at the beginning.
He's got a bunch of sneakers on the floor, Jerry Seinfeld famously as like hundreds and hundreds of pairs of sneakers.
But so but also the weird.
It starts early in this mood because they're driving around at Adam's driving around, and he's like, Hey, that girls like you don't talk about that.
She's his cousin.
Is where all cousin where I'll just get a bunking jump.
Isn't it really gross that we brought that up five minutes in in the in the start of the film, when he's getting ready to go out for the day, shoves his stinger in a pencil, sharpeners him, just like pounding the part?
I think so, man.
He's gotta hide it because he doesn't want to see through his graduation robe.
You cannot take a shower to do it right.
You have a machine like if your dick was coming out of your ass, you know, like maybe you have to have their be, like, more jerk for, like, everything.
It doesn't, though, because that's what I was saying.
That Steve, before we went on the air, there's actually no, and you would expect this.
You'd expect a little like Stinger to come out of Matthew Broderick's pass, and he'd be like, legging it ground like there's no erection Stinger.
Correlation, because I feel like that was the one thing they couldn't do.
What else?
This movie's gonna get shut down.
It's so close.
But he wants to be bone Resnais, Zellweger, human the whole time.
What, You know, what would that entail?
I think maybe, just like fluttering your wings on while we could go to resident Beastie Ality expert Chris Cab.
And you tell me, is the bump will be going to be a Jeff go boom s like later.
What has to be big like you can't have It doesn't you don't need to insert anything, Chrissy.
There's other ways to pleasure to the last week fighting the last episode famously canceled.
This would be a horrible way to go out.
Also, did anybody else think it was kind of interesting that his name is Barry Bee Benson and one of Jerry Seinfeld's like First everything's was guesting on Benson?
No, no.
Yeah.
I mean, it's not that interesting Initial His initials are also BB.
No, although wait, did you know that he's a fan of the graduate?
Oh, yeah, that What a stupid thing with this.
So the whipping is like it's a socialist utopia in the beginning.
Like basically like the idea is you haven't you get you get a job given a job by the be government.
But the good thing is, you get to choose it, right?
Be government.
Tell me what to do.
Give me a list of options for employment at a fucking disgrace That got done.
Beer, knee, Sanders In this whole place Socialists, I get my own my news for be part man's.
Yeah.
Look, honey, So fucking what you would outside like I like freedom B b um, Steve Bean in is good for this country.
I actually I'm almost positive that Sean Spicer is a be in a man, cause dude, he definitely he's a bunch of He's a everybody's He doesn't live at the president of the president.
Looks like five radio.
Oh, sorry.
I did my Sean Spicer impression go too long.
It might sound a little something like demons fucking each other to death at midnight, so But the idea that's good.
Keep going.
So I'm almost there so poor that honey all over my face.
This is a little too thick.
Can we wanted down this yellow honey a little more asparagus so he doesn't want to choose.
A job was a free spirit type, right?
Matthew Broderick was like, Oh, this is so exciting.
I can can't wait to be whatever.
And he sees this weird thing called the pollen jocks.
Who are these?
Like tough guys.
My God, They're so Gopalan plant.
Come.
It's called Paula.
It is an Eric.
What I am was a beer everywhere too.
A k a plant.
Come.
Yes.
So you just bring that for all our younger listeners.
Do that of your earth science class.
Mr.
Chefs, Kitty, just plant comer work.
I'm trying to simplify it for the old man.
Now, I just fucking failed Earth sides.
Get I kept right on plant.
Come on.
Every sending me to the principal.
It'd be irresponsible to say you should continue listening to this.
If you're attending any type of educational, even it's even an academy.
The academy certificate course to fix TVs.
Turn this off.
Listen, if you're studying for your science regions final, okay, Photosynthesis ain't plant ejaculation, all right?
It's not.
Yeah, it's sort of, you know, language.
That's what it is, right?
What your teacher told you, See, the light makes it come.
That's what we do anyway, right as we just saw it, we just teach towards passing tests anyway.
Way get into Bill.
Get a P.
That's a joke.
This is like, Oh, you did great.
You got all these and they'd be like, Wow, you're a fucking average student.
Very A's B's, like a like a g g.
Get the bottom, too, because the way the A tell me where the spot is for that right below the F man.
That's fucking stupid.
We're doing the movie.
Yeah, you're right.
Speaking of buckets do bitch, We're not sure if we're gonna have another episode.
We'll figure that out.
So this is actually and we're not doing listeners request so but rip Torn p I wanted to talk about be ripped or my God, I'm sleeping in a B A t m investing because I'm so drunk.
I thought I was my goddamn out.
Might be shot.
I look on Ms Stump in its own all sorts of different hives.
Just my It's just my No, please don't call the police.
You can have all my honey.
Honey makes it all go away.
Don't call the be police.
So he does go like they're, like teasing him for something.
Him and, uh, speaking a plan Come.
Him and Matthew brought her to make themselves look tougher.
Put pollen all over their chest, which I've done that before.
It's invigorating.
So they go up to these ladies and they're like Yeah, we just pollen and all the shit.
It's pretty cool.
What ones?
Who they call hot.
Don't.
Oh, they're so which is amazing because both of the bees look identical.
They're bees and doesn't also their babies.
And then, Ah, Brodrick is like But didn't you just say that they were cousins, their distant cousin distant enough for fucking?
Yeah, I'm already but I'm already there in my head already there, guy over the message of the mental arithmetic of you having to see this Be fucking Your brain is like nothing, right, Like it's just every single second every second I know V.
It's a sexual awakening film guess so.
It was like the graduate is in that way.
I think.
What?
I should start doing this.
Stop teaching the graduate and start teaching bee movie eso he goes out.
He's like that.
They kind of tease him like, Hey, you know, why don't you come with us and we'll show you the ropes, kid.
Well, it's kind of interesting, because I thought that I thought we were, like, setting ourselves up for, like, a fucking bully pit situation here.
It's not that they're just like, hey, come fly with us.
And I was like, What?
These guys were being quite nice.
Also, we did forget to mention we got a point as many celebrity voices possible.
The principle that the graduation is none other than the great Larry Miller.
Best Jerry Seinfeld.
Yep.
Best buds.
That's a good best Bud to have Larry Miller better than these buds.
Well, we'll remember that when you need a fucking kidney.
I was about to say, Well, we're gonna be around longer than Larry Miller.
Thought.
I looked around the room and us again.
We're not.
We're gonna die soon, So he goes and they find a tennis ball like a tennis court.
And this is when we get into the job.
The gigantism finished that this whole movie's got.
Now, Steve, you're talking about this.
And, like, I've I've known you for a really long Sure.
I mean, what if it's one thing I know about Steve say that it is?
No, certainly not.
I mean, look at it.
Nobody.
That's his fetish.
It's not my fault.
The other one has noticed this, Steve, That's what I'm getting to.
Steve knows a lot of weird sex.
Sure, he's into a lot of weird shit.
The's no way we're going off just eyes is a witch hunt were saying, like, you know, we're getting to this gigantism fetish and I understand, like in the world of the movie what you're talking about.
If I were to be like, say, Steve, say Neck and I was trying to practice a gigantism fetish, what does that entail?
I think it's all just like you just read stories and jerk off.
Oh my God, it's a big woman.
Oh, it's not like anything you could like roll just like looking R crumb cartoons.
Yes, you could probably role play like whatever, but it was like stilts.
I mean, eventually, we're going to get to Mexico suits, and that's like the first man ever built a giant woman like a step on some dude's nuts.
We're gonna fight the robots, but first this one is going to go.
But that's the way it is with all technology, man.
We built it.
It's like, Here's the thing.
It's like three questions, questions.
The first we built it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Step two does it like shocking when you touch it?
No.
Okay.
Step three.
Can I bucket.
When can I fuck it?
When can I make it?
Help me, FARC.
Look, I just want a hand job this time.
Ally Chris, we're recording.
I can't do that right now.
I think this is a stern, but no, What I'm saying is that this movie was like it was like Jerry Seinfeld to be cute movie, right?
That's totally sure it's him, you know, he's got to save the high from the other hive or whatever else has happened.
But then someone in the writer's room is like, But what if there was a huge woman that could crush him like a bug?
I just think that that could happen.
Can I draw?
Let me tell you, they drew this back, Donald.
But no eso.
They want a love interest.
Why not just have a B A B A.
B would be a great idea.
World deserves a boner.
Here would be.
Don't a girl be mega?
Malala is in this movie for a second.
You make her the girl be a beetle.
You didn't even use a beetle.
That's fine, too, because we do get into that, too.
We're also talking about inter special insect sex But that was about to say how sexy this they draw you want you finish your set because I'm talking sexy cartoons for sure.
Sure, they draw this Renee Zellweger.
Hey, look out!
Look, this is a sexy cartoon.
Now I've known Andrew for a long time, and I've known it for everyone.
Anyone you meet on the street, we'll let you know that Andrew jerks off to cartoons.
Oh, sure.
Well, here's what.
Doesn't you bet your business?
Well, here's what I'm mystified because I think this is just like two steps up from the fucking dire Straits Video.
You are absolutely right.
Yes, you jerkoff way.
Come on.
Who here in this room hasn't pleasure themselves to the money for nothing?
Video.
Geez, you're down to some dire straits if you're there, I only jerk out to the video within the video.
Listen, it's 2004.
The Internet's out in the dorm room.
I'm hard up for material.
What do I have in my Kazaa download?
Volvo Bunch of music video, like all have his u h f.
I'll have to use that part where they thought of it.
I want my MTV man.
Who, Doctor?
Yeah, but like so they're at the tennis courts and they all like they're flocking to the tennis balls because I think that they're flowers yellow, the bee thing and then sew like Jerry Seinfeld be Barry Bee.
Benson gets stuck on one and he gets stuck in a gets stuck in a volley between Renee Zellweger and her husband, Putty.
But there's also like a Velcro fetish thing bef for the Yeah, like these are fish like little Everything's finished like that.
Like touching is like, Oh, that's so good who that's so good and then like Barry does, there is important and buried, does it?
And that's what gets him almost killed and water.
An idea for the story.
Just for the story.
For the kids movie.
What if he gets hit by a tennis bullets?
He's almost crushed.
See that?
I can see people love getting hit in the nuts.
Harold.
I understand the finish.
Big constant peril being crushed by thing's a little weird, but at least having your nuts crushed.
Man, that's a thing.
Or like watching gerbils mice, haven't you?
I think we're gonna have Bork us.
If anyone still is sitting by my mom by the way, lesson tune into our new podcast.
That's a thing.
It's beyond the patriotic wall.
Eso he winds of escaping this tennis ball, but it starts to rain.
He winds up going to his nasal Wickers house.
He's almost killed by Patrick Warburton.
Who's your boyfriend?
Who are different, not boyfriend was.
Oh, is that right?
I think it might be kind of patrol shields.
Greg's about being unemployed all the time.
Now, this is what I wanted to get into.
Could we talk about their financial situation?
Seconds.
So, basically what happens to live in New York City?
They live pretty much in the exact neighborhood that Seinfeld takes place, which is kind of funny.
They're multimillionaires.
Upper West Side.
But this is like on the park.
People on Seinfeld didn't live on the park.
These people are right on the park.
This is where no 17 figures, not six yeses where no regular human being can live.
Right?
So, Hee, I think that's the one time.
It definitely doesn't work now.
It would be like the best.
And she's a flora.
She Yes, she runs a flower shop and he owes the flower shop to be fair.
She owns well, Doesn't own a age.
She owns and operates a flower shop, and he's boastfully unemployed.
But she pays the lease.
Yeah.
You know, she doesn't like again different metrics.
She doesn't own a chain of Yeah, and that's what would be required for this apartment.
I mean it since they live, right?
It's like Central Park West.
What are you talking about?
And later they're romantically hanging out under terroristas.
Well, like what is going on?
Those things gorgeous.
Fucking Dana Barrett's apartment.
Another fucking impossible apartment in movie history.
Yeah, Cellist.
Okay, well, the lace, I least that was the eighties for this'd 2007 Mike.
I mean, the Coke brothers put money into Lincoln Center so which they should have never accepted.
That's fucking criminal.
That's true.
That's a different.
But Barry almost gets crushed by her boyfriend.
Bo gets saved by her and her big delicate.
Okay, you just can you just be careful.
So she saves him.
He's like, well, like and then, like, he falls in the right.
His heart is aflutter.
He's like, Well, I got to say something.
She's so beautiful.
Oh, my God.
That's this big human lady is so beautiful.
And this is the most tense part of the movie for me because I was like, All right, here it is, Ju pin.
If any point in this movie, we're gonna have a B boner joke, it's coming right here when he realizes how to fall in love.
But thankfully, who you skirt right under that radar with that?
See, I thought I was gonna happen when she gives him a crumb.
Oh, you see, t taste.
He tastes like it's like a drags coffee.
Que eso?
He does start talking or she thinks she's crazy.
And like, there's some stupid line where it's like the number one rule of bees is we don't doctor humans shore number one rule first rule of bean Club Talk about it.
So, yes, So they have, like, their first date on her, you know, Upper West Side Taras looking over the park.
And she's like, really okay with it instantly and then, like she offers him a cup of coffee.
This bee is drinking coffee, and he's all like, Well, I don't wanna put you out, but But maybe you'll put out I love coffee.
Why i'ma be doesn't let's go to a Bonk said.
You feel any better?
There's this one guy in the writing room writing this story, and then everyone else is like, What about the cute be stuff?
Because every five minutes somebody brings back the What do we want to go back to the This movie swings between like Kid Friendly and Ralph back.
She fast.
I mean, it'll make your fucking head spin, man.
He's like, Well, I gotta go.
I gotta go back to the hive, and then they start like, talking about like, ah, Brodrick like you and your human girlfriend.
Oh, my God.
Inter Loberg!
Oh, my God.
Do you like the deal?
Like the biters, right?
Oh, that sounds like the spiders, like the hottest type of insect.
And Barry Bee Benson is like, doesn't do it for me in the face.
Just like like oh, like the last thing you could do you should do is take a wasp poem to your parents.
They'll kill.
You were also doing Jewish stuff because we say we're we're be ish.
Which sure, if you really have to, if you really require this, that and that's when Steve Bannon turned this movie off.
He was like, Fuck you, Jared.
We're not watching this.
I'm out.
We're ready for you.
We're gonna screen finding Dorrie at the White House.
Do you think that was about Was anyone invited?
Was that just that big fucking orange baby watching that movie?
Apparently, they're kids.
They're like the staffers.
Yeah.
Oh, I set the pences where there was a fun party.
One of them fucking families that reviews all toppings on a pizza.
You stop it, they can go through a whole sleeve of saltines.
You know what?
I just have I just imagining a party with my fences there, like he's in the corner by himself.
Like you're you're doing.
You're mingling.
You come over here like a like you having a good time.
So you drive that cracker before you.
You wanna have a funeral for it?
Because I got I got a kit.
Give a tiny funeral.
I bring around my little cracker coffins because anybody drop snacks at a party once I have one strain.
Sex too.
If you You had a note, Francisca.
I mean, it's just like nothing, but if you had, if you had a gift made of this episode.
It's a fucking train falling off its rails.
But no, I had a lot, and I think I don't remember where this is from what I remember being like What the fuck I just wrote Drag queen joke.
Oh, yeah.
What's one?
You know that?
That so that's coming up.
We'll get okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not I'm not trying to push ahead.
No, no, it's fine on their second date, which is definitely a date.
They're, like, doing like a Woody Allen through a grocery store kind of thing.
Yeah.
Oh, you're right, because they're just talking just like he's like, flirting with her in the grocery store.
And this is injected over me.
Do you think this is the thing where, like, Seinfeld, like, always wished he could make, like a well like, um, like, take, like, take his like, neurotic writing, Sure, put it into a screenplay and make like an Annie Hall thing.
But it's like this the best we could use a goddamn animated be cardio.
That's the thing.
Like, just make that movie, Jerry, it would have been terrible.
You make it for $2,000,000 you have like, it's having making you Brad Garrett and some lady, You couldn't have been any worse than what is it the thing that Larry David directed in the nineties?
Fucking sour grapes with Steven Webber do that?
You can't.
You can't with as hard as David did.
And you know what, man?
If that movie's fucking sucked, a dog's asked.
You know what?
You're still a goddamn 1,000,000,000 exactly.
Make me suffer through this B movie.
So But they come upon the Honey Island.
He's, like, all freaked out about us stealing my honey.
It's like the rape of Europa.
He's fucking freaking out over this shit.
This is when this movie starts to dance around the Holocaust quite a bit.
Yeah, yeah.
Tap dance around the Holocaust he follows.
He goes to, ah, Honey Farm or whatever.
Like a series of B has to face off against the crazy grocer.
Yeah, that dude and that Listen there.
So there's a Ray Liotta bottle.
Ray Liotta, honey, right?
There's a thing where it's like like in this world, it's Renee Zellweger and this fucking this grocery clerk and later in the movie Patrick Warburton.
And then later in the movie, the entire country.
Everybody is way too quick to accept talking bees.
You're absolutely like this.
This grocer is just like I knew you were talking b and he liked takes a thumbtack and he starts sword fighting with Barry Bee Benson.
He's pissing their pants.
Nobody's like talking in the fucking thing.
This your pants if I started, like, if I just was, like, hanging out and I saw B That's it.
That's the thing.
That's the thing.
Um uh, thank you for coming to my house prostitute, by the way.
Oh, no, I think I see you're talking be Oh, no, do anything for you.
That baby is luxuriously coming, although for my have more water.
Oh, that beast talking.
You think water?
Oh, no, they're talking.
Take this asparagus and water shake I made you know They can't fly if you put water on it.
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
Be You want to squat over?
Yeah, Let's just say that's water.
So hey, rubble filtered but nobody Renee Zellweger stabbed herself in the hand when she finds out Oh!
Oh, I think I'm dreaming.
She doesn't fucking weird.
Fight club Shit!
And And Barry Bee Benson is just like, you know, I'ma be not like don't stop use over the hand Looks like b club, but they cut out your beak, Love.
Oh, my God.
This would be a totally great fight.
Club moment.
Robert P.
Pulse.
It was a look at that.
Be with man boobs.
Let's blow up the credit card.
Yes, Where is my hive?
You met me at a very weird time in my life because I'm a big I'm talking be so I wind up going Thio This is when we see this honey farm and there are rows upon rows upon rows of like, work camps, like drab and like wood.
And it's not the natural hive.
There's no beds there.
Anything Seinfeld goes in and they're like what he's like.
Why are you here?
Like, Oh, we have our queen here.
And that's not a queen.
That's a drag queen.
Oh, right.
That's what it was.
Just er yes, it was a man be dressed up like a woman.
And what's amazing is that, first of all, I want that movie.
I want whatever that be struggle was like being in the B propaganda department at her movie.
Here's the the most ridiculous part of that whole gag is when they look at the picture of the Queen Bee and it's the drug queen.
You look at this thing and it's a be like in a dress and it's fat.
But then it also has like a five o'clock shadow.
It's just that he doesn't have a beard, man.
That's just that's just stupid.
That's just really fucking stupid.
They get gassed over and over.
They sure do.
You think this is?
We've already established.
There.
Be It is precisely, and you can see this coming from a mile away to your picture.
The theater's filled with families right?
Who are like we got little kids were also huge fans of Seinfeld.
Let's go see this movie and like these air getting gassed in the camp and just slightly.
Those parents heads like start to crook a little bit.
Those they're just looking at the screen like way.
They've had a cock sometimes thank you.
Think they get a whiff of something but the gas hits and that had just started Elton, like, should we get out of here?
Is movie has a hidden agenda?
I don't appreciate it.
No, no I love it.
Actually, I love every delicious second of this agenda.
Bravo!
Just say, Oh, I wish it worked.
I wished the bee's got gassed.
I mean, you know the question is, is it really okay or should we be punching beekeepers or not?
Guys, You know what I mean?
Like that.
Listen, we hit movies approved.
It's okay to punch.
Definitely so whatever.
Then he decides to sue the human.
This'll be kind of functions like a dream, like you know you're doing today, which is why he needs the fight club in.
Exactly.
You're doing one thing, and then you're doing another, like, really quickly.
Then you're doing another thing really quickly.
What also we we we skipped out on his way to the far right.
He's like he's like, hitchhiking by like going on windshields.
Would not any meets Chris Rock Mosquito on.
He's just calling a moose blood because Chris rocks like I'm going to Alaska because there's there's moves up there and that moose blood will get you fucked up six ways from Sunday.
And he's talking about like how all all mosquito women always want to trade up.
They want to have sex with grasshoppers and whatever else and which is insane.
Just really weird.
Like what?
Why don't they just have Let's not talk about sex at all?
This is this is What's weird, though.
Is that stuff that he's doing?
Because again, this is like you get comedians in a room and thing.
We're like a comedian's just doing a veiled bit, Yes, but this is, I mean, this movie's 2007.
This is Chris Rock doing a bit from, like the late nineties again what some of those early Chris Rock specials and like AA lot of it is still amazing.
But there's a couple of things, and there were like, Ah, yeah, uh, you know, And that's that's like reminding me of those things more than, like, other Chris rock bits.
And I'm just like, Come on, moose Blood 2000 just fine.
Can we get on with it?
So anyway, so yeah, he's speaking of getting on with that he's suing the B company.
Well, honey, cos you're the human race.
The human race course from the Graduate to judgment at Nuremberg soon you because you won't have sex with They definitely do.
Ah, graduate thing where he's laying in a He's in a pool of honey and do the mirror the whole, you know, Benjamin falls in the water.
His father does like the plastics type speed.
Yes, your honey.
The weird thing is he goes into a fantasy, whereas and it's Renee Zellweger P gigantic.
And like, they're like at a picnic in a park.
And they're like, they're being very romantic together to make sense.
If it was your fantasy that she's the same me, But no, but I don't remember that.
No, she gets a d o a plane, and you got to do a little biplane toe like fly around with that.
Yeah, that was a giant.
But yes, to your point, if your fantasy wouldn't you be like, Oh, finally we could be weaken b to get she shrinks down, though, by the way, it should be because you can't have a giant be that the fucking terrifying.
She's a B, and he's a B.
And that's the fantasy.
It's like, Oh, if she turned into a B o man like you be like the end of Shrek, actually.
Oh, yeah.
That was a weird turn for Shrek.
Wait in the district.
The human turns into a monster.
Yes, a beautiful monster.
Eric.
Yeah.
Okay.
Shrek on.
And then she stays a monster for the next five.
It's the next three films and multiple holiday, and they're also know they're putting out another one soon.
Just wait.
Feature film.
Are we talking ABC Family Fuck face.
Come on.
Three of those ABC family's now call the Reform Party.
It's a free form.
Fuck faces a chance.
They could have, like, more like, like kind of like hard hitting show.
Every time I had a show about a letter with a lesbian for fucking ivory, saying, Finally, there's lesbians, you know, we'll just call it free form so you could shut the fuck up.
It's fucking free form now.
I can't say shit about exactly still hate lesbians, though it is, exactly You learn to countries going in the wrong direction.
Also, though.
There, thank you.
There's definitely there's definitely a puss in boots, cartoon show Chelsea and I looked at that one day one day and that there's it's like fucking five seasons deep.
Sure, yes, I know that, and they're bringing it back because they're gonna do more of it.
was there was also a puss in boots feature right through this franchise is a fucking where, sir, and they're now John Goodman, man.
Jesus, What?
We go to the trial, I guess, like, and it's really like this movie is a bit fantastical.
Could we talk about be Larry King a little bit sure where they really like turns in on itself like Barry Bee Benson is on be Larry King.
They do a brief interview, and then he's like, You know, there's a Larry King in the human world.
Tui and Larry King's like Be Larry King is like, Oh, it's a common name and he's like, No, he looks like you.
He's hunched over, he's got glasses and I'm like, Man, I am laughing my tits off.
I can't even believe it, You know, you dish like you, all right.
That was where the bee ish comes in.
You could be on our new show with Be Larry King and be Jesse Ventura.
Oh yes, See The Beav and juror Jesse The Be Venter is the one that he's picking apart.
All those be conspiracy.
I am of a beer list believing in free freebies.
Who's the other person on their way up.
The one hive government doesn't want you to know this stuff.
They're floored.
IDing the honey, the're humans have it off.
The humans have taken it there.
There's the fluoride in the honey.
I support Barry Bension.
I support him and his cause.
I was once the governor of Bina Shoda.
Figure that shit out.
I think that week Eby leaks is doing a very good job.
I think that that man Julian Basan just a real America.
You have to get to be truth out there, and you have to You have to make sure everybody sees it.
I know my friend Bernie Sanders would.
It would definitely agree with me on this point.
Yup.
And when those two honey Combs came down, something fishy going on the high you've doesn't want you to know about.
And there's where the angry tweet.
But I definitely believe in B'Gosh She got but herb e mails.
Oh, my face.
He goes to war with the human race.
He's got this trial and he's representing the bees.
At what point do we are we supposed to believe, by the way, leave Opal part of me?
Uh, also how it always 2007.
So, like Justin Bieber was like four.
Yeah, they can't be.
That was good.
You can't, though.
Nobody would just stay.
We're doing sting jokes and Sting looks like shit in this.
And so Wellit's not Sting's fault, what with it being a cartoon or something, he just looked at.
It looks as bad as food looks looking really sexual thrills.
There is a scene in this movie where Sting is doing tantric meditation.
These levitating That's yeah, they catch him right before he's about to pound it.
For Fourth Is Power the boner.
The weird thing is like the trial, such as it is, and John Goodman is playing the opposition lawyer, and Oprah Winfrey is playing the judge.
She is, and also wise.
Barry Bee Benson, a qualified attorney.
Great question.
It's him and Matthew Broderick who is just working at the fucking honey factory.
Sure, you know what I mean.
He's though.
Oh, everybody can defend himself, man.
But, like, why don't you, like, be Roy Cohn?
Be Johnnie Cochran, Beanie Cochran be Robert Shapiro.
Uh, totally Beashel Wallace.
Yeah.
Listen, any famous lawyer turned into a B because his movies not above making stupid fucking bee puns about names.
Sure, exactly.
But the weird thing is like, it's if that singer don't fit, you must acquit.
They're doing so like we're talking about, Like, a weird appropriation stuff, too.
So that's what we do with these.
You can't.
You can't be called Sting.
You know, ageing isn't everything.
Things just like, Why are you drunk, men?
Great question for a lot of people associated with B movie, by the way.
No, I'm not drunk.
I just want to get crushed.
You don't?
My favorite soda is Welch's grape.
That was actually confusing.
I'm sorry.
So cumbersome.
Is it?
Uh, Ernest Borgnine.
Coffee.
So wait, What?
They had.
No, I've not.
I have.
It's all right.
It's coffee.
Soda?
So it's not good.
Well, wait a second.
I'm sorry.
He's been dead for years.
What is Ernest Borgnine have to do?
It was his recipe.
Yes, he stumbled into this house himself.
I had this years ago and like a has been in a deli.
How it was that, uh, he was at a pizza place.
Really?
Woodstock?
No.
Yeah.
It's, uh that was not the only place where you could get this.
It existed.
I don't know if it still exists.
Conference soda exists.
Comes at a Manhattan specially.
That wretched Ernest Borgnine says much better.
Okay, good.
I thought about it when I was had some down time on the set of that magic military helicopter show.
I was on for a while.
Air will air.
Whoa, thank you.
The joke would have functioned better if I remembered the fucking name of the show.
You get it, though, right?
Fuck it.
But so, like he's doing, he brings up Ray Liotta, who owns a honey company.
And there's like you and we're doing that kind of like, really like slick jokes at this point, we're talking about his Emmy that he won for yard were like talking about really Odo like That's a thing.
So that's who the fuck remembers.
That only has 2007.
So maybe you might have, because it was 05 But they say that he won the Emmy.
Did Smith come out, man, Every time you bring it up, I think in the hard days, just moving in New York City.
Me and Eric Cisco, blissfully unemployed, eaten bad Chinese food and watching t vote episodes of Smith.
Those were hard times.
That was a very short run TV show with as like a criminal is that he was there.
They were like thieves or something.
Amy Smart was farting around on that.
Only a criminal can catch a criminal of some horseshit eyes in that show where only a cop can catch a cop.
Yeah, he's like the Jay Leno Show Taylor.
Now that's Ray Liotta wearing a Ray Liotta mask.
Every promo for that porcelain unsettling.
But Leota is the crooked one of J.
Lo's.
No, she gets in on it.
Wait, I'm sorry.
You watch and shape had to review the first season.
Would you give it a B e o.
You know what that fucker did it, but now I did.
So he's like, you know, And look, Ray Liotta, somebody fucking kill this be we could just go back to our lives, which I totally agree with that question.
My wife actually brought up that point earlier in the film of Patrick Warburton had been successful, it murdering this, be sure we're talking about a grim 20 minutes, and then you're done with the trial's going on then we have this Really?
Because again like that one writers out of the movie for a little while.
And then the writer comes back that way.
Where are we in a trial?
We have to go back to her house because he's gotta be.
Ah, home record.
Red lights.
It's this weird thing where it's like this thing where they're having dinner together.
And it's really a Zoe wigger and the B or having dinner together.
And then Patrick Warburton comes in is a What's going on here?
What are you guys doing?
And you know what?
I'm on Warburton's signs.
Of course I am.
My wife's having dinner with a beer.
My fiancee's have a dinner with a B Well, where that's where's Where's the funny farm?

It would be like.
And that's one thing when the, uh when it comes out that that lady's having sex with swamp thing in the Chaplain get over and ruined is ruined, man.
She loses her job.
But that mental health facility.
You know, that swamp thing?
Alan Moore line kind of falls apart towards that last volume.
But I'll tell you what, So I'm thinking space.
Yeah.
First we're gonna drain the swamp, gets that thing.
That thing is stealing our women that think it's going to be on my wall.
Ah, Could pee with a boner swamping.
You can't just fake news versus Batman.
That's a great is.
I swear to you, I'm pretty confident that I gotta look around a little bit.
That might be the best comic book I've ever read.
It's fucking awesome.
Really cool.
Anyway, B movie, the lawsuit our in law and order in an hour, the dinners.
All right.
They have the big domestic disputes, like a fucking John Kasich bodies move.
It is.
She's like, Oh, you're home late.
You're home early, and you're gonna be later.
But supplies, I'll teach up some food.
Yeah, you do that.
And then, like, they have this weird CDs like, are you fucking my wife?
B r u b fucking my wife.
And here's the weird thing.
And it got annoying after a while because, like, I like Patrick Warburton.
I think He's funny as putty.
Yeah, there we go.
I think he's funny.
His buddy, he's got a good voice actor turned out to be funny.
Is Putty Venture brothers too, Actually, but like he is just screaming and his move.

Something more on the ferry.
This year's wings of desire.
Look, I don't have got to change it.
Don't even got a perfect waves of desire.
But it's bees instead of angels.
You know, listener, community, someone make that poster.
It's a be sitting on a ledge, looking down.
That's all you gotta do.
You know, the Zion, eight different lenses in and minds guys.
Seven was definitely going down that path.

Very Seinfeld, Be, uh, excuse himself to use the bathroom, which he makes a bee line and then, like putty goes in after him And, like just a flush a more letters, the fire.
There's a fucking fights.
There's a really stupid like it's clearly like somewhere there was a hit list of like things we need this be to do.
We need him to say we need them to say Dog a dog at some point like you makes a joke.
But then there's gold.
Gold teeth says that, and this you can tell We're really just like being crazy.

Because you're fucking Jerry Seinfeld, you're 50.
You made $1,000,000,000.
You should never want serves up ever again.
It's just, you know, he's so out of touch and he's trying to be cool.
So it's just this poochie it is through.
This is Poochie, the movie.
You're totally right.
The whole two minutes that he was in 30 Rock promoting this movie.
All right, so much better than anything in the move.
Because listen, sometimes it's okay to solely function inside the television run.
That's totally okay.
To be the best at something.
It's great to be the best.
You made the best fucking sitcom of all time.
You did it.
You don't have to highlight how mediocre and bad you are and other.
Don't Michael Jordan yourself warts ownership.
You're gonna add that to the list.
Jesus Christ.
Isn't that just the saddest man he'll never see a championship with?
That I have is a gold palace, says the Hornets.
Oh my God.
My favorite team is the Charlotte.
Yeah, he's so great at sports ownership.
Yet fucking Patrick Ewing could never be a head coach.
Whatever.
Whatever.
Hey, whatever the fuck ever, man.
So fucking B movie Surf's up.
Dude says she wants up breaking up with her boyfriend.
Do they break up?
Yes, you get out of here.
Oh my God, you tried t o be boyfriend.
And like she's looking for it.
John Goodman.
He's playing his playing this like, sleazy lawyer and he's doing like us.
I say, I'll say, I'll say Southern law, and he's being It's like they actually draw this character.
Very disgustingly.
It's supposed to be disgusting, like villain character, but like his big, fat ass is just like hanging out.
This suits like barely fitting any.
And then when he way have to talk about Adam's.
So at one point he's shaking a big fare front of everybody.
And he's talking there about how volatile bees are dangerous things.
That's what he's trying to break down.
What's your goal?
He's trying to break down Germany.
Roderick Jerry Santero wants very trying to get him all excited.
You break down the witness and he's staying on the selection show.
You got a little girlfriend there.
He's putting over new Zellweger and everyone's throwing up.
Are you guys like bad bugs together?
And I'm like, Oh, that's so discussion.
Like that movie within a movie and talk to her.
And if one of the rules here can I talk to you?
I'm a human.
We quietly see her.
You Can you draw me a picture?
Hi, Y'all do it.
And then if I'm in like the audience of this courtroom, huh?
I'm just throwing off course and just despairing at the at the state of affairs.
The world's in And how is Oprah Winfrey, without argument?
One of the greatest human beings to have ever been put on this Earth.
Sitting here reading this script like, Yep, this sounds great.
The color purple in B movies because she's a billionaire.
Friends with Seinfeld, right?
Big discussed this on a helicopter.
So while they were pushing lesser people out and then what happened was Pinochet murder Death?
Thank you.
Still, like throw people totally.
And then what happened to you is crazy.
They landed that helicopter, and Jerry Seinfeld was like, I just bought it the other day and her, him and Oprah started laughing, and Oprah set it on fire and destroyed it.
And then they went and got.
They got a modest sized lunch.
Goodman was on conference call.
You're not going to use the same helicopter twice?
No, it's discussed, right?
Little right.
The bus helicopter twice.
Uh, but so the this points Ah, Adam.
Matthew brought her to sting him right out of his big butt.
And the idea is like, Oh, my God, Look, these peas are untrustworthy than Adam goes to the hospital.
He's treated at a human hospital at a human.
The hospital and they were talking the whole fucking movie.
Yeah, well, you can't sting someone.
You'll die.
You're totally right.
And I was like, This is where it happens.
They've been talking about death constantly.
They've been talking about how you can sting because you die.
Here it is.
Here's your beaches moment.
Yet Matthew product's gonna have some weight with this movie's gonna die Then he's just hooked up to Ah, honey, I sure give him, like like a toothpick type of fucking stingers.
He's got, like, a cocktail sword thing.
And fucking John Goodman is voicing a man.
A man in a baby walk around all rain because it stung in the bow.
Right?
That's gross he's got.
And then you know what?
That's a thing, baby.
Finish your baby stuff.
Starts paid 68 of my script.
No, let's get into the Sharpie marker.
There's baby stuff, man wearing a day bird.
It's so much like he's getting so anyway, Baby could crush me, baby sitting on my leg.
That's like that awesome game.
Zombies ate my neighbors.
Where there's the big baby level, baby, you gotta shoot bazookas at.
And that somebody something.
Mike Pence has a funeral every time you play that.
So a lot of more people have been playing.
That thing's the proliferation of any later head keeps on burying my genesis outside 16 bitter 18 bit thing.
It's still a baby's pixel Baby.
Your dad Thank you.
So let's pray to Christ.
Remember that time not springing a praying to Christ member that time, Uh, go Hoosiers.
We thought that, um, his one daughter there was a vampire Mike Pence took some stupid photo one time and like due to the angle or whatever they were at some fucking Hee haw Golden Corral plus two shit restaurant or something.
And garlic.
Andrew, let me stop you standing a bit like a New York City elite.
But you can continue their fucking there at the most beautiful, beautiful restaurant, right?
Olive Garden is gonna say apologies.
They were at an old country buffet, and what happened was they were in their table, was in front of a mirror on they were at the time, like they hadn't They hadn't won this thing yet.
They're like, Oh, that guy might be the vice president.
Take a photo and it's his fuckin stupid family on the way the angle was you could see like Mrs Pence and Fuck Face.
But then, like the daughter just wasn't in the reflection.
Everybody was like She's a fam.
I wish you know what I would.
I would feel better if they were vampires in the White House.
I like the idea of that's a choose your own adventure, a cartoon series I'm gonna make or three first kid vampire, That's it.
First kid who's also a vampire.
Here's the Red Stevens and just definitely way it finds a little too much.
Is the rest of the family vampires?
Is it like President Obama?
President Frankenstein?
They're all monsters like Idea Copyright.
Eric Cisco, Steven.
Wait So that that's a great idea is like the monsters.
But it's the first family.
We'll get everybody, you know, you'll get roped into Fine.
Everyone's going.
How did actually, in the spirit of like, stupid ass TV specials, how did the monsters never become the presidential family?
I wouldn't say they have.
I would say that I don't remember it, but I wouldn't say that they have in it definitively.
You had Grandpa Al.
He'd be like the secretary.
He ran for a bunch of stuff.
Yeah, I, uh, said I voted for him.
I don't think that happened.
I would have voted for 1955.
Did Grandpa Al Lewis was running for, like, mayor of New York City like, yeah, Like I thought this was a plot line from monsters.
No, Grandpa Al man.
He was, by the way, ask your grand parents about the monsters a little tell you about that great grandparents.
You know how young these kids?
Okay, Grandpa Al Lewis, man.
Because he was, like, born and bred Roosevelt Island, and he was running for something that unless you're criminally insane So they're smoking going on outside.
I'm like, Right, Jerry Seinfeld's Oh, that's right.
Smoking And he lives is our Kays.
That's what he brings up in the in the hole.
I think I don't know who he puts on the stand like some guy that runs the honey farm, and he's talking about the camps that they have and the smoke that they used.
Your Nuremberg Bergman.
Oh, yeah, big time.
It's really weird.
And there's this one.
This is really weird line where you're taking our culture and you're making us slaves for the white man and then they cut to the jury.
But right And the jury box is all white, except for one African American guy.
And the African cartoon goes like he slides away from the rest of them.
It's really kind of started it.
It's the other lawyer.
It is the jungle.
It's the defense table.
Yes, yes table.
And like his, his co counsel is a black guy, and he moves down the bench like you.
Yeah, it's really weird.
Like, what are we talking?
Well, that's that's a move for Johnny B.
Cochran to make.
But you didn't hire him.
You didn't.
Christopher B.
B Christopher Darden, right?
It's be Larry King.
A Christopher.
Don't be Sterling K.
Brown played him in something of, ah, be Mark Furhman dropped a fake stinger at that house.
Paul in all over.
Oh, mercy.
So here's the thing you like.
The movie should be like over ish, but I paused Netflix and there's a 30 minutes left.
What's going on?
I got to correct your friend because I made that same paws.
We're talking 40 minutes.
Like what?
How is their 40 minutes of this movie?
So he wins the case they're like, All right.
Hooray!
The bees become complacent, I guess because they have money.
They don't have to work all the honey in the world, I guess.
The only in the world given entitlements, man.
They don't worry.
He's fucking be handouts.
That's true.
That's true.
And, sir, we wouldn't have flowers no more, man.
And this starts getting really fucking weird.
Took flowers.
Thing is, the movie should be about global warming because that's something that was going on at the time.
I mean it still going on.
But by the way, global warming were a hoax invented by the Chinese.
But Theo bees were disappearing and they were very worried about that.
For a little girl, I remember the bees.
That's a Chinese hoax.
Don't you mean that China is China, China, China?
Let me tell you something, Chris Cabin.
Gina is stealing the bees.
That's what happens when BYU's can pollinate flowers.
You know, flowers start to diet exercise.
That's that's a big deal.
And then they're like, Oh, everyone's upset at Barry Benson like, Oh, Barry Benson, you and your lazy be friends.
Wait, what will be on my watching anymore?
And like he hatched this plan with Renee Zellweger.
They have to go to the Rose Bowl or Tournament of Roses.
Thing is, this is next to you know, it's like a Rose parade.
I don't know.
I was assuming it had something to do with Rose Bowl.
Also, because I know that the Rose Bowl has a parade with a bunch of flowers.
Sure, so you know, whatever, whatever, whatever.
Let's call it that.
Maybe they couldn't license the Rose Bowl parade.
Maybe that was the problem.
They go there and, like, uh, he's like, Let's play Princess and the Pea, You be the princess.
I'll be the B.
Now we're role playing with animals, FARC, so whatever.
I mean, they steal a bunch of flowers and they go on a plane, and now the plane starts to crash right this.
You know what a zit Turns out the third act of B movie, it's just a little too much.
This is like Air Force One.
We're like, Oh, man, this movie's so good.
But when you re watch it and you're like, Okay, so Harrison Ford kills these terrorists.
That's pretty cool, huh?
And then Oh, wait, no, no.
The other stuff 45 minutes of him trying to land a plane.
Other stuff Gary Oldman is dead Way too early.
Before the credits roll will have the way for fucking William H.
Macy Divided it off my be Oh, you know who directed that?
Phil America.
Wolfgang Peterson.
Did someone say Peterson?
But yes, of the plant Like Jerry Seinfeld?
I think I don't know.
He causes these.
He goes into the cockpit and he somehow makes these two pilots, like, knock each other out like it's a Three Stooges gag.
He talks to them for some, pulls out a box.
Honestly, I think 2007 is a little too early to make.
Hey, I've incapacitated the mammogram, rotting the cockpit, Absolutely have beer.
No, be exactly.
And he gets on the intercom and he's like, Hey, Renee Zellweger, come to the cockpit immediately and I'm like, First of all, yeah, we're six years off of 9 11 There's some fuckin U S Marshal on the plane who shoot Renee Zellweger in the fucking head.
Are you kidding me?
That would be an ending.
This woman just gets up on bum rushes the cockpit.
Also, this guy just sued humanity for all of humanity.
Man, this movie is stupid.
But like he would be on a list, he would definitely a no fly list.
You can stop.
So that's very s.
So she goes in there trying, They call up Matthew Broad Records.
I'll get all the bees together and all these bees, like create a nest, hold the lift of playing up.
But then also, there's a bunch of bees on the ground and they're like, This is where you land the plane.
Oh, dude, you gotta fuck it.
Put it in that Flowers with your pollen guns.
Holland Guns out.
Just suck up all the policy about cameo.
Speaking of too soon, Uh, only like eight months after the famous comedy club.
Did that happen in 2007?
That haven't six in 2007?
Michael Richards is in B movie like right at and he's very un Michael Richards to didn't notice him.
He's the air traffic controller and it's very just like there's, like, no affectation to anything like he's just reading it to be like, as a kn Michael Richards is Tossed Mobile is here is embattled.
Well, yeah, because he he tried to he tried toe a rip off a bit by what's his name there, Lenny Bruce and blew up in his face.
This isn't funny that David Letterman fit where he's like, Oh, engines is talking on a wood starts love you blurry and Sand Falls.
Next.
Why are you laughing?
This isn't funny.
That was awful.
That so that's the most cringe ist video.
You could have got to look this up to you.
It's horrible because what happened was like Seinfeld was guested to be on Ladder Man are scheduled to guest on Letterman, I should say.
And so like the Michael Richards thing, it just happened.
So incomes Michael Richards like live via satellite.
He's like making this apology or trying to, and everyone's like Kramer on.
They think he's like, joking around, he says, Afro Americans, which makes people laughter like, Oh, that's kind of funny and says everyone in the studio audience at the Ed Sullivan Theater itself just starts laughing.
And Jerry Seinfeld's like, No, this isn't funny.
Hey, it's It's signing up trying to be serious, which is kind of funny, and it's come through a door.
Funny, you get through a door, be funny.
He's not wearing that jacket.
That's how you set it up.
There's a door frame and the door bursts open and it's just a screen.
And these live by satellite.
But it was just horrible.
And then he went into hiding and didn't re service to curb your enthusiasm.
It's been a while, but then that turned into a funny bit, though.
Yeah, sure, that worked.
But at the time, that was it.
That's rough.
Video watch.
It was a bit bit soon for Michael Richards to reappear here.
Here's how.
Here's how uncomfortable it was, though I remember specifically sit at my desk.
I mean, the subway sandwich.
I put the sandwich down.
I couldn't even eat what I want.
I'm going to save this till after the videos would have vivid memories.
I really like subway.
Uh, what movies brought to you by subway under promo code racism.
So all the flowers are dying and whatnot way landed the plane.
Everyone's a gay were like all the flowers.
The B start fucking him immediately.
He's like, Listen, this is the last of the flowers off the entire planet.
Get fucking and all these, then that we're just shooting pollen and everybody now eight minute end of this movie So that, uh, here comes the sun with Cheryl Crow starts.
Yeah, that was that was me expressing my distaste for Beatles covers.
I thought that was the listener.
I was about to chastise the lead, just me blow and raspberries.
So the end of this movie is not only does Jerry Seinfeld be turned into what he always wanted to be, which is one of the pollen guys, really also, boy, he also runs a law firm with Chris Rock in the back of Renee Zellweger's flower shop.
And here's the thing.
Chris Rock has the line where, like, first of all, they're taking a case of a cow.
Yeah, first summaries, because she's like, Oh, you know, they're talking into their steel in my milk.
I feel like a piece of me, And I'm like, Don't make me think about how cows get slaughtered.
First of all, I don't care.
Show me as many videos.
The one I'm still getting a fucking hamburger.
Second, Uh, it's definitely he's got the line right.
He's like he's like, Oh, well, I've always been a blood sucking parasite.
Now I have a briefcase, and I'm like liar jokes.
B B B.
It's like her flower shop is back in business just to shutter it, by the way, because there's no more flowers.
Her gigantic flower shop, it's out of nothing gets me going like failed Enterprices.
But now her business is getting a bit this'll screenwriters.
Real pervert.
She's gonna open another one expand s.
So it's like there's a There's a law office in the back.
Also, why does a baby need to hold back off?
Great.
Just put him off to the side on the count of the cow.
Also, just either make him a lawyer or a pollen jock, as they think is at the end of the movie, like he's doing this law case.
And then these pollen jocks like Hey, five o'clock, we got to go pollinate some stuff like Talk to you later today, Zellweger.
I'm living my dream job it It's so so stupid like just let him be the pollen jock.
They give him a cool jacket that's in Jerry Seinfeld loves cool jackets.
There's a whole episode about it, but, like why?
Why this this law firm Fuck you stupid movie just end.
How about you end your movie and then it just ends?
He's like flying through the city.
Dude, did who Beatles covers.
Fucking shove them up your ass.
Every last one I am, Sam soundtrack should have been the fucking Sam.
I am out.
I'm looking at you, Aerosmith and that fucking come together cover.
Oh, that sucks.
Oh, it's Suggs of vines.
It's something on.
Of course they did.
The vines.
What about it is everyone's like, Oh, you know what sucks about Beatle songs?
They're too short.
Let's make him long.
I know it's grazie.
Yeah, they should all be Rush song.
Exactly eight minutes.
Fucking Beatlesone.
No, thank you.
Oh, Lord.
And then, Yeah, that's that's that's be moving.
Move.
That's all, folks.
Did anybody stick around?
I was waiting for Stinger.
See, my wife said the same thing.
She's going to bed because first of all, my wife, my wife, God bless was put up with a lot of like you're watching.
What?
Okay, we're still married, but do the movie B movie should do the line.
She's like, I'm going to bed Is a very smart lady way smarter than me.
But so she was just going to bed because let me know there's a Stinger scene now I know why.
Marriage a baby end of the credits, though.
Not a Stinger scene.
But you got this weird shit with Jerry Seinfeld and Matthew Broderick, and they're just singing this like duet with each other.
Did you see them or you just No, no, no, no, no.
It's like the credits are just about over with and you're like, All right, this movie's over with.
Sure, and then Matthew Broderick and Jerry Seinfeld just start sinking, and it's like a shitty like, old timey musical like jazz thing.
Kind of think they're just like singing some stupid song.
And then it stops and he's like, I'm a be back to work like it's totally unnecessary, especially if you're not seeing anything.
Maybe he was on the soundtrack, inspired by and featured in the movie.
It's just Cheryl Crow, and then that shitty barber shop Do it.
Puddle of Mudd Did a sign up to be Aaron.
Luke Mamma be Aaron Lewiston Acoustic number.
Honey, hit the floor.
I'm afraid to be B the this in concert.
That sucks.
That sucks.
It sucks.
So do me a favor.
Don't worry about it.
Would with anybody recommend B movie?
This is I'm I don't know.
I don't ever want to predict the answers here, but I think No fucking way.
Alright, Chris Gavin.
No, I saw this movie twice.
It just it.
It's really long.
And we should be talking about for animated movies.
You're fine with an hour 20.
You're fine with it once.
You crafty 80 minute mark, your golden kids already pissing and shitting by the 18 minute mark.
Exactly.
But I feel like I'm a fucking watching the bridge over the River Kwai.
It's bullshit.
I wouldn't recommend it.
I mean, there is a seeing is believing element to it, but I don't.
That's what I was worried about.
That's what you were worried?
I was worried someone was going to say they recommended because, like you're doing there, that's not a recommend.
Okay?
I was worried.
Other people are gonna be like it's seeing his be leaving.
I mean, like, you're fine.
I mean, the internet will tell you what this movie is.
That video Get some gifts?
Yeah, that's fine.
Also, that video that's hilarious is the movie speeds up every time they say.

And it's better than watching the movie.
