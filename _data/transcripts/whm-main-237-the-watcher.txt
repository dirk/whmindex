Hey, folks.
Now let's get this episode going.
We're talking about the Watcher.
I'm excited for this one.
I'm Andrew Jupiter Stevens Erickson, and we hate movies.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to we hate movies On the Side Show Network.
Thank you for tuning in, as always.
Now, this week we're getting down and dirty into the year 2000.
The film's called The Watcher.
It's directed by some fella named Joe Shar Banik or Char Benac.
Something like that.
Hey, who cares?
Point is Chiana Reeves serial killer movie.
Now who is the Watcher?
Is that us?
Is he talking about?
Oh, watches the watch, Getting a little meta there, I feel.
No, it Sze What rights?
What they call.
That's what they call Keanu Reeves in this movie.
He's not watching.
He's not watching anything.
He's young.
He's killing young lady.
He watches them beforehand quite thoroughly, were told and takes extensive notes.
You everyone does that.
He also a shitty DV cameras for eyes.
It looks like because, like, yeah, I think he's filling them on the DV camera.
But you find out sort of midway through the movie that no, that's just like Cheon New Cam.
It's my eyes.
Cataracts.
Dude, it's amazing because you're totally right.
It's like you're watching this movie.
It cuts to shitty DV cam stuff and you're like Also he's got, like, some digital camcorder jerking off.
Yeah, he's like, really doing some thorough research stalking these women.
But then there's a scene where he's just talking to Marisa Tomei, and it cuts to this video.
There's no camera in sight.
It's Chiana Cam on all of a sudden I'm watching tape with fucking Robert.
Sean Leonard, I want to throw up.
Oh, mercy me.
Um, so this movie starts with, I think, one of my favorite Chiana Reeves moments ever him dancing to Rob Zombie's drag Gyula over.
Dig through the bitches who baron through the ditches.
Where was the wishes of the ditches and burn through the witches?
The frame?
I'm going back.
I'm out, you know, doing it.
But Eva during a going to get them talking to dirty our human burn.
Hillman.
That doesn't.
But actually the funny part is later in the movie, because it's your classic shitty moving, framing narrative.
Later, he's doing that dance to a different Rob Zombie song.
Mark, who is that excuse me.
Is that white zombie?
I think that's a white zone.
Put your tweet down, sir.
Thistles like he's doing like, living Dad.
Let me.
That's definitely Rob Zombie.
He's doing like, this little hip little kung food dancing dude, Everybody was come through dancing.
And he's doing it with a gun too.
And also, that song appears in The Matrix Regular D'oh!
Oh, yeah, Big like, Oh, what am I?
What?
That just came out last year.
What happened?
It's a total.
I'd rather be watching The Matrix situation with this movie.
If that's what you're getting at.
Does this movie take place inside the Matrix?
No, It takes place in Chicago if right.
But should have done big.
Is the Matrix right?
Pretty big.
Is it just that Australian city which I believe had Chicago street names or some such?
Oh, I I don't recall.
It's maybe it's a government.
I don't know.
Maybe this could be The Matrix is with Granderson.
You let yourself go.
Mr Anderson, we believe you are purposefully out of shape for this serial killer movie.
Mr.
Anderson, you finally look like a hacker.
Mr Anderson.
Pleasure to meet your chins, Mr Anderson.
I'm your grandmother.
Give me Mr Anderson.
I'm an overweight podcaster.
The pot is calling the kettle black.
Wait.
Did you just say the pod is calling the kettle black?
That would have been pretty smart.
I meant to say pot.
So that's ever came out of my fat mouse is whatever came out of that mountain, So but, yeah, he's a little pudgy.
And for Chiana Reeves again.
Oh, I mean, he still looks like 1,000,000 bucks, man.
Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9 15 88 80 and 80 Grand Fucking brutal.
Thank you.
Go past.
You got 1,000,000 bucks from some bank robbery, and then you gotta pay 120 to the cartel.
That's what you look like afterwards.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, I mean, so translation.
He still looks fabulous.
And James Spader, And this is, like, $900,000 but like in 1929 right before the stock market crash, because you would see it starting here.
But right after this movie, it's just like which will, because everything's gone.
This is two years after his crash.
And that's the movie that kind of like put him off on like a different career to reject trajectory a little bit, right?
There was a pretty good movie, though.
Yeah, but not at the time.
Like nobody gave a shit about it When it came out, it was, like, totally just thrown in the trash, and it kind of killed his career a little bit.
I mean, in the nineties, you couldn't have.
Ah, like a love sequence with Elias Koteas as a man.
Yeah, you know, you man on, man.
Like the fetish, sex was kind of demonized by Newt Gingrich.
Interesting.
Used to say that this movie, it's a gay movie.
It's a movie about one guy that's in love with another guy.
Watcher.
Watcher is in love with James Spader, and it never gets it.
Never.
It's always just just you're just It's right there like the Paula Cole song is about to start playing.
But nobody officially presses G eight on the jukebox, man, and you just sit there like Come on, do it.
Just fucking do it.
Do it!
Hey, Cheon, who?
I saw my own private Idaho fucking do it.
Do a dog.
Just do it.
Come on, Spader.
Well, it's It's like it's if single white female didn't have like if at the end she wasn't like, Yeah, I've been in love with her the whole time Like physically romantically in love with her the whole time.
Like it's where he sent Todo happen.
Yeah, I want to see them kids checkoffs cock.
I better go off by the end, right?
No.
Kept in my cock meant Stop making a mess on the bridge.
Set cocks to stun Lord.
It went off in my tiny pits.
Kept in.
Perhaps someday I'll be made Admiral in a useless fan film.
That thing is, it's nothing to do with that.
Movie's a piece of shit, Jim.
Is his cock going off again?
Oh, God damn it.
This is the 10th time has been a check for that.
A doctor, Jim, not a cock doctor.
Captain.
It's illogical if I should have to slip on the bridge one more time.
I'm trying to do important reports at my science states really spot.
It's kind of making me nostalgic for old America movie theaters when you find a sticky floor.
In this movie.
We also have Marisa Tomei as Lorraine Brocco in The Sopranos.
Yeah, because what a useless character in this movie.
She does nothing.
I mean, she she's kidnapped bait the whole time.
And you know, she is the psychiatrist to James Spader.
Yes.
So a little backstory here.
So James Bater is an FBI agent who was is an FBI agent formerly stationed in L.
A.
Where he was going after Chiana Reeves, who is the serial killer that you know, watches women and then strangled them with piano wire.
A mishap at a crime scene has caused Spader to lose confidence himself in himself a little bit.
And so he moved to Chicago.
And like any obsessed lover would Cheon, who follows him to the Windy City on high jinks, ensue.
Pretty good concise synopsis.
We should get into the student that they do this thing where they keep whatever happened in L.
A.
Is a big secret in like Wall Cheon is dancing in the beginning, there cutting between it and the whole movie.
They're like cutting between the whole, like whatever happened in L.
A.
Is so boring in the non starter.
It's like it's what it's all window dressing.
It's like, Oh, we told you what it is you'd be like, Oh, fuck this movie, right?
Like if you keep building it up and building it up.
But I had the wrong info in my head the entire time watching the movie because what it is, the flashback is there's a woman tied to a chair.
Spader runs in the house.
There's a fire.
No, there's not a fire yet.
Spader runs into the house key on who runs out, and he has to do the like.
Do I untie this woman?
Just run after Cheon knew.
And he does like that.
Are you okay?
Good.
I'll be right back.
The house catches on fire.
This woman burns to death.
Basically.
Sure.
So James Baker, like, blames himself for But the way they frame it in these flashbacks, I was like, Ah, fuck man Cheon who killed his wife?
This that the other thing.
I mean, it's so not even a thing.
It turns out like it was a woman that he was sleeping with.
But that woman was married.
But it's like, what?
Why?
Why does it just make it?
His wife cares unless the other guy is a factor.
Unless Quiano is actually her husband, for some reason, Or maybe she's married to Marisa Tomei.
Sure, whatever.
Ernie Hudson, who's in this movie, listened for five seconds.
It comes up to like Ernie Hudson makes the main credits.
And I'm like, you know, fist in the air like hell yeah, here comes Ernie Hudson.
I love him.
I mean, we're talking four minutes of screen time over the course of a 97 minute movie.
Honest, it's an atrocity.
Don't tell me Ernie Hudson's in a movie and then have Ernie Hudson be barely in that movie.
He's got his cop mustache on my mustache, said Cock mustache.
Oh, those air pretty hip these days.
God dammit, Jim, theater urologist, I've been telling you that is what is causing it to go off in my pins gift, and it's Mike area.
Your pubic hairs has nothing to do with it.
God damn it, you fucking green blooded Russian.
I wouldn't I shaved my pubic hair in the one point because it started today.
That's what we call landing strip.
Uh, so Spader is like he's in a rough patch.
He's I guess they never really established.
If he's currently working for the FBI, not he's on.
He's on disability, always that always got get the disability checks say, because he's got, like, mind altering my gray.
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
And he he's like injecting himself with migraine medicine, which I didn't know was a thing.
One of the one of the first scenes is him coming home.
He's got a walking can, a Coke he's just walking around with when you are thoroughly depressed and suffering from migraines.
Feel free to walk around a loud city with an ice cold.
Coca Cola brings it, hoping he's got a brazen the mail.
He specifically as a FedEx package that he's after bucket and he drops it.
It's amazing because it's like you get this great moment of James Spader acting being like Look, wait a second.
Twente FedEx on men like him opening it be like, Yeah, I do.
Well, it's amazing.
I've never in my life, but in this situation where it's like, Oh, I have mail or I have a package and I don't immediately open it.
There is such neuroscience that go through my head when I have mail and I got opening.
I gotta just get it over with.
It's probably bad news letters of whatever, like I'll get to them sometime during the day before the next mail comes in.
But if I get something from FedEx, that's like, Oh, that's irregular.
That's an eyebrow is raised.
Either this is a really important letter for my creditors or it's a picture of a dying woman.
So this turns out to be a picture of a guy, you know, as as was the fashion at the time.
I got a quick question, though, So yeah, Spader's apartment, you know, it takes a nap before even get suspect.
Just so goddamn busy with this can of coke.
He's got newspapers all over the place.
He's a hoarder.
It okay, I was wondering is that he later throws up on them and I'm like, Is he just kind of like living a hamster lifestyle?
Like I was gonna let newspapers down?
Oh, our hamster like the animal.
Not like the member of Mark Wahlberg's entourage, P.
D bro, not number.
Not my buddy hamster, but like No, he's like living like a little animal where he's got like, allover is how Listen, that's the way to live, man.
You want to get those hardwood floors messed I believe that James Spader shits like a parent.
Just palate droppings.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, yes.
Oh, he's just he's suffering through.
So he gets a picture, and it's like, Oh, no, he's back.
We have no idea unless I missed it.
Like what The time frame is.
No him leaving L.
A.
And like these new letters starting up with these new photos.
Starting guessing just from some of the conversations about six months to a year because of Cheon is like later talks about some in between time.
So you know.
But there's a great moment.
Just this, like disgusting Spader hoarder lifestyle, he opens the fridge.
The Onley thing in his refrigerator that's edible is a lemon, and he peels it and starts eating it like an orange.
I almost vomited, and he's just like sitting on the couch like first Will do.
We have, like one grizzled detective or FBI agent that's got a fully stocked fridge with, like chilli from last night in one Tupperware.
You know what I mean?
Maybe he makes himself a nice like he went to the deli the other day.
He's got like, parachute.
It's a party cheese on there he's got Rio and he makes himself a nice bucket.
So what can I get that once in my life?
I mean, I'd love to see it, but you're not getting it here cause he can't even bring himself to jerk off, which is what we learned.
That's how you got interested in character.
No, because it's when he's peeling this lemon and just eating it.
There's a Victoria's Secret catalog and he opens it and he's got, like, a page between his fingers.
And he's like, Mmm mmm.
To ogle or not toe Ogle.
And then it's like, Nah, he just closes up like this Dude is suffering so hard, he can't even play with themselves.
That's a tough road I don't want to be on which he gets magically cured.
So actually, somebody gets killed in his apartment building.
He comes home.
That's a turn on.
Yeah, now he's our and he's ago.
And you know, the detective is this guy because he was Chris Ellis chrysalis.
Been 1000 things.
Everything.
He's doing a Southern accent in this movie for no goddamn reason.
There's one woman putting on a Chicago accent one and she's got, like three lines T.
James Bater in this movie and that is it.
So, um, he then finds out, Oh, he has a picture of this woman in his house.
It's been into the mail that's been collected.
And then he's got, like, two other FedEx packages that Oh, shit, that girl's dead.
That girl, I think, Well, it's awesome because he goes to Chrysalis like he calls him up.
And he's just like, Hey, I know that girl who got murdered or whatever.
Uh, and he's like, Well, how'd you come by this information?
He's like, Oh, isn't this FedEx package I got?
He's like, Oh, great.
When did you receive it?
Because two days ago, you dick, you total dick.
Yeah, and I think that's kind of what jump starts.
This whole thing is like Well, shit, man, like the blood is on his hands.
He's got to get back into the game, he says to him, like also, by the way, I know who did this because this dude and I, you know, kind of had a Batman and the Joker thing for a while there, that's the worst.
When you get that go and then you try to move and the guy follows you.
And it's not even like Look, man, just get your own life, you know?
So he basically gets wrapped up in the FBI investigations.
They want Chris Ellis.
Oh, yeah, really?
Should be Chris Ellis or Ernie Hudson.
Yes, I don't think that makes you have deep.
And it's great to have them both in a movie, but they both have to have something to do.
But listen Chrysalis while being a fine actor, and he's totally fine in this movie, this is the Ernie Hudson roll like Ernie Hudson in this movie is playing like the dude above him.
It should be reversed.
Like Chris Atlas is like the Commander.
Whatever Ernie Hudson is the guy like, you know, pounding the pavement, right?
Yeah, totally.
And and then it's kind of fine because it's like, you know, the dude who wasn't in Ghostbusters is fine.
Having four minutes of screen, exactly.
But let fucking Ernie Hudson be in this movie.
Please.
Did we mention what can or even his character's name is?
Oh, it's the please you tell, uh, David Alan Greer?
No, Is that that's a comedian.
It's still been Alin Griffin It's so close to David Alan Grier way vigorously.
Close Thio.
Somebody says it like Oh, fuck, it's gonna be David Alan Greer.
Well, it's awesome, too, because I don't think every actor in the movie knew the name of James Spader's character because he's like Joe.
What?
I never knew it.
Joel.
No.
Well, okay, see Perfect.
It's Joel.
But some people in this movie you're saying, Joe, they definitely are.
And I'm sitting there like, What is this guy's days?
What is his name?
Joel.
But Joe for sure.
Yeah, I dropped that l the Ellis silences.
It's French Joe, but David Allen Griffin every time, like, Oh, it's David Allen like it's gotta disagree.
Oh, don't arrested.
He's a comedic treasure.
He was great on in Living Color, but it's just every time, really.
Oh, man, it's like having Ah, Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald Lee Harvey Osmond.
It would be the guys like my friend Lee Harvey Osmond that's in one of the Osmonds, one of the lesser ranks, I think market David Chatham, James Earl Johnson like it's just like the's, our names.
You're allowed to put on screen Adolf Hitler.
That's a movie I'm making Thanks for ruining my It's pretty sexy, Stephen.
We have to burn the script to Adolf Hitler.
We think you know what that was The alternate title to the night Porter.
Bravo.
You're welcome.
So, Chiana is, by the way, um, Spader, get them right.
We're different people.
I'm just can't made out of guns.
Um, cons.
He's dough.
Oh, my God.
A remake of The Wizard of Oz with with Chiana Reeves as the team.
And I'm just made out of cans.
I need a heart.
There you go.
Perfect.
David and Greer could be in there somewhere.
I'd love it.
Uh, so, uh, spinners going to Marisa Tomei who looks exactly like the woman he was banging?
Yeah, that's a little weird space.
There's a bit where you have to.
You have to announce that.
And he's like, Yeah, I'm shopping for a psychiatrist, but I think I just hit the jackpot.
How many people go in that office just to hit on her?
She's got to be like, You know what, man?
No, Chiana does it.
How many people do you think visit you because you're so beautiful?
Like I know you're a serial killer, So you but really Ah, double you.
So he's on the case.
Kyoto finally calls him.
It's OK.
It's me.
I followed you to Chicago.
Chicago's sucks.
It's so go.
Doesn't get in a dig a New Jersey for no reason.
Yeah, that hurt my feelings.
What does he say, Ventures?
Is that at least he didn't move to New Jersey A and then they both go.
Oh, jokes.
But he got basically, is like, Oh, I'm gonna make, uh, I'm gonna make a game, okay?
Do you wanna play a game like I'm gonna send you a picture every time?
Because because you've not been opening my mail that you have.
You been receiving my packages?
I got delivery confirmation.
Shipping isn't free, James Spader.
It's bullshit.
Like us, I'm gonna gonna need signature required.
Wasn't because I was spelling your name without the silent l.
All right, Spitter, you're gonna have to go into the shipping hub to get that picture.
By the way, it goes totally dead.
It's open between the hours of 10 and one.
It's a really inconvenient part of the city.
And you have to go there to get the picture.
I didn't want to come to this because you're literally home all fucking day, but no.
So he says, I'm gonna send your picture.
You have until 9 p.m.
That night.
Oh, yeah.
To find this woman or else I'm gonna kill her like that's the game.
This is the game of cat and mouse.
We're going to be catting and mousing.
Oh, sure.
And let me tell you so this is you can tell that this is the year 2000.
We're making this movie and 99 that Dragila, in the beginning well tipped off due to Dragila.
Also one of the most prominent prominent locations in this film is a mall.
Well, that's what I was getting, too.
So there's woman that he's stalking works at a camera store in a mall where you can buy film for a film camera.
And when I when I was watching it, I was like, Oh, I should warn the audience if they find themselves in this particular situation.
But you never will know because thes stores don't exist.
But what happens is he walks in and he's like, Can this film do whatever and she's like, I don't know, I just work here and what he does is he loads the film into this camera and he starts taking pictures of this woman.
And I was going to say, You know, all you people out there listener land.
If you're working at a store, a camera store and some dude comes in taking pictures of you in the camera store, you should probably call the police.
But now that's just what all everyone does everyone taken, no matter where you are.
You getting your picture taken?
Oh, yeah.
You'd get some selfies in there?
Yeah.
Then before you know it, you're on vine falling down an escalator search.
Eric Cisco following that a don't don't encourage it.
Sze out there.
But I don't like it.
I saw it happen.
No, I'm glad my acting getting better.
So there's like a manhunt out for this woman.
They're trying.
It's more like they're trying to protect her at this point.
Get her Not so much trying to, you know, wrangle Chiana.
And it's a thing where he is picked the perfect victim because this woman has no friends.
This woman has no family in the area.
She has a job that no one even looks her in the eye when they're buying camera.
Quit.
I found a lot of this stuff.
Unbelievable.
She's totally clueless.
Will remember also.
I mean, look, we're talking about the late nineties.
Were writing in making this movie.
I mean, there's no social media man you get.
It was possible to be off the grill, but yeah.
Oh, she's still totally clueless, if that's what she said.
She's an attractive young woman for you and for you supposed to 24 years old and what not and you know she's She's not involved with anyone, which is fine.
But like James Spader gets a picture of her in the mail, right, That's where we're leading up to.
Yes, and he's got a day to find her, whatever their killer.
And they're talking about how she's like this shut in or whatever.
And James Spader's like, Well, he's not going to send me a picture of a prom queen.
Yes, that's what I was like.
What is that?
Dig?
Yeah, yeah, number one.
She could be a prom queen.
She has classics.
Glasses.
Yeah, but if you know, if you're involved in a bet and you get those taking on, she could be.
It could be all that there might be a She's all that prize is a stupid bet.
She was just a stupid bet.
She was a game to me.
I took her to pro.
Listen, man.
Attractive people could be Cathy cartoons, too.
Okay, I guess so.
I mean, she's sitting at home.
They have.
I mean, it is a Cathy cartoon XI minus, like, the pint of ice cream.
She's got the cat.
She's watching a movie that she comes in in the middle of and her life is so meaningless that she doesn't even care to start a movie from the beginning.
Oh, come on.
You have all been Not everyone's you, but that's what's happening.
That's what's happening.
And then your mother calls her and harasses her about whether or not she's on a date.
Yeah, Walking, living, breathing Cathy Cartoon.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
I just, uh I don't think this movie is very good.
We'll know it's on.
We hate movies.
Of course, it's not good.
It's on the block.
The name of the show that you've been doing for six years.
I resigned.
She So the only thing is so James Spader's a burnout like he's doing drugs and blah blah.
The funny thing is like he comes back to the FBI or any Hudson's like All right, you're the you now lead on this case.
He used to work it and this guy named Mitch Casper well used to be working it.
Oh, the dude who hates his rotten guts.
That's a placeholder name.
David Allen Griffin.
Yeah, these these names, they're all making the final cut, which is awesome, but so, like he Spader keeps shitting on.
It was like, Hey, you know, blow these pictures up, give me an A list of these names and blah, blah blah.
But the interesting thing is, like Spader as a detective in this movie is not a genius, like it's not.
He's not doing like Sherlock E and like, oh, that she's using this.
That means she's left handed or like he's just working.
The case is, he's just like he's just like, hey, Easy was mostly out of his element.
It really does it.
So to me, putting it, Mitch Casper on it.
You know what?
Mitch has been working this elastic fun.
Spader is a consultant, but it's Mitch's case, but I think you know, it's Listen.
It's like maybe it's a seniority thing.
Maybe it's a you know, Joel has been working it since l a.
You wouldn't get those.
Oh, Joe.
Yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Forever.
That silent L So this manhunt goes on and on, They, like, get to the mall.
They do a bullshit thing where James Spader is standing in front of a glass elevator and the woman gets on the elevator and Spader doesn't see her.
And you're like, Well, in a good movie, you'd be like he's right behind you.
But in this movie, you're like, Oh, the Watcher, whatever.
Yeah, I mean, they they get to too late.
Quiano kills.
We did a little bit of Chiana Reeves in this movie a little bit about maybe why he's in this movie.
Oh, yeah, this is it.
This is a new, interesting couple of tales.
There's two different theories out there.
One for Aunt my imdb and one from Wikipedia.
IMDb says Quiano attached himself just because he liked the script, but the role was really small.
Cameo is a gal be a serial killer.
You know you'll get me for a day they locked him into a rate.
But then they started shopping his name around.
And then they got all these other people and more money, and everyone wanted making more money than him.
And then Then they also bumped up his role.
Think about how this shit works.
Both James Spader and Marisa Tomei got $1,000,000 for this movie.
You You shit me 1,000,000,000,000 bucks apiece, man.
Wow.
And Marisa Tomei's in this brief like nine minutes.
Candy nougat scaled New canny noo!
I'm making scale, you idiot.
What have I a dragon?
So the Wikipedia, Theo?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's one of those nights.
Eso whatever.
He tried to get out of it, But then he realized that being a lot of legal trouble, So he just did it.
Kind of very begrudgingly, right.
The the the Wikipedia theory is so much better, which is that one of his friends signed his name on a contract and that's why he needed to be in the movie.
You imagine some dude just like oh, this will be hilarious.
We're gonna make Chiana legally bound to make this Mooney.
What do you do it?
Brian?
Brian, did you sign my name to a contract.
Brian just switched my cell provider, You idiot.
Brian, I didn't get HBO until today.
Brian.
Brian, why am I doing the Watcher?
Oh, no.
I'm doing the Watcher.
Brian, Brian, get in here.
This document says I'm doing the Watcher.
True, Brian, Look, I allow you to open my mail, allow you live in my pool house, Brian, But this is too far, Brian.
I never thought I would see the day when my executive male assistant double crossed me bride wear my matrix sunglasses.
Are you walking around town in my matrix sunglasses?
Brian, take off my speed jacket.
Brian, I got that.
When I made speed, Dennis Hopper gave it to me as a present.
Also, don't talk to Dennis Hopper anymore when he calls, Put me on the phone or say kion news, not home.
Dennis, Stop committing being a serial killer Movies, Brian.
Oh, fuck Brian, The lake has come down.
You mind the replacements?
Brian?
It's a football movie.
Look at me, Brian.
Do I look like I know anything about football?
Brian, did you shred the good billing, Ted?
Three script.
You're such a dick, Brian.
You are now assistant to the assistant of my mail opening.
Ted, get in here.
You're Bryant Supervisor.
Brian's not living in the pool house for long.
That could be your spot.
Ted.
That's gonna have to find the gun.
Jeffrey, I just imagined his house is like a really nice, you know, palatial Hollywood estate.
But it's also, says Cheon New Industries on it.
You know what?
I'm like the gate?
No, like inside of his bedroom.
Does he have mirrors on the ceiling?
Yeah.
Oh, sure, Brian, I owe you an apology.
John Wick was a total success, man, but what a ship thing like who knows if that's true?
But can you imagine?
In either case, it's very clear that he doesn't want to be in this movie.
Well, you could tell that from watching the movie.
I mean, you just watch him in this movie and like I have said this on the show before, and I'll say it forever.
I fucking love Chiana Reeves.
I will watch Chiana Reeves and anything.
I have seen the Lake house goddammit!
But you can tell in this movie he's just like man, that fucking Brian is a real son of a bitch.
What a terrible April Fool's Day prank.
It was signing me onto this movement.
It Brian take over like right after River's edge after River's Edge.
No, there's been some good things since River's edge.
Speed, I guess.
Right?
The Matrix.
Oh, the other main trick.
Look whenever it is and I'm saying it on the air.
So Weaken sues somebody.
If this happens, the side podcast I want to get on the air one of these days catching up with Cheon.
Go through all of a man.
Every single thing, including TV show, ensures you ever on your guest spot.
Ah, he had some TV movies and things like Starting Cosby Show Man, I don't think No, that was Adam Sandler.
You're thinking of Brian?
Why did I get it?
Why am I supposed to be on the set of the all right now?
Why does this week's director of this week's E are upset with me?
You know I don't want on my bad side.
Brian.
Michael Crichton.
You might not remember Brian, but he helped develop that show.
Now I know I didn't get the lost world.
Thanks, Brian Being help, bro, Imagine a scenario At some swanky Hollywood party where Chiana Reeves is trying to meet Michael Crichton gets the coldest of short notice with the Who.
He said something about Well, it was convenient.
I bothered to show up to a party, but not toe work.
Brian, do you have any idea what that could mean?
Any idea what that's in reference to said, I know couldn't even play a robot in a Westworld remake.
That's what he said.
Brian Ryan, You know how much I love Westworld, right?
Like really, really love it.
Brian.
It's so awkward now.
I can't go to Michael Crichton's funeral.
The bad blood has gone so far.
Hey, has put me in his will that I can't be in any project that is so fucked up, Brian.
And you fuck that up for me.
Stay tuned for Michael Craig's funeral, he's dead.
Is he did it for a couple years.
Is long dead.
Really?
Yeah.
No.
I tied a cancer like three or four years ago.
Possibly longer.
One d wait, he wrote the book R I P D is based on is the one time you dabbled in the world of bad comics.
So this woman dies.
All right?
Yes.
She's long dead now.
The 2nd 1 is like a busker or something.
She's at down in an n n n No.
She's a runaway teenage, run, run, run, run a runaway.
But she's not a drug addict.
You just kind of hanging out.
Not old.
She's runaways, a drug addict.
She is a runaway train, and she's never coming back.
Turns out, yeah, she's going the wrong way on a one way trip to Chiana.
Catches her eye.
He's walking in the street, and she's like, Oh, you know, spare change, spare change.
He's like, Hey, would you like to dance?
She's like, No, there's no music.
And just like flirting with this guy, I mean again, he was like the honorees.
But like, get the fuck out of there, lady.
Oh, yeah, I mean, well, yeah, you know, serial killers can be handsome.
We're talking, Ted Bundy says, Oh my God, he was just a handsome this dreamboat till he killed you.
Uh, it's kind of awesome because it's like it's one of those moments.
He doesn't say it, but it's sort of implied, like there's music everywhere.
Bullshit thing.
You hear people say and they're just like dancing around in this public space.
And it's like Embarrassing is embarrassed.
So she gets the next picture and then we're running around there and, like her mom, like her mom finds her on TV, and she's like, Oh, my God, she's a runaway.
But just like, still pissed she's like, Yeah, I don't know, whatever that one over there think she's gonna make something of herself.
Your daughter is in the crosshairs of a serial killer, madam.
Yeah.
Oh, it's awesome because she's like they see something of L.
A.
When was the last time you heard for?
She's like, Oh, yeah, she called a couple months ago.
Said she had a new boyfriend.
A liar.
Yeah, right.
It is like lady again.
Crosshairs.
Serial killer If you don't mind what I love about this teenage runaway is one of her big lines to beg for Money is going Hey, Dad, don't you remember me like just trying to like she's not very good at being knows grifter.
She's very bad, but just you, I think the fact that should goto like like oh, there's gotta be I don't know in this public plazas, probably 30th.
Strange, I I've been the estranged father District of Chicago, 16 to 17 years old.
Somebody must have had sex 16 to 17 years ago.
Right?
Didn't like, would that have ever worked?
Do you?
Oh, is that what it's supposed to be like a surprise kid?
Inning?
Yeah.
It's like, um, your kid Now, Now I'm your kid, but all I need from you is a couple bucks to get on the l will know.
It's that's it's It's the panhandlers credo, which is to stop you in your tracks, no matter what.
It's one second, one second, one second or the uh, you'll see this in Times Square.
And if you ever come to Times Square a.
Don't But be anyone that wants to give you a free CD.
You don't touch that CD.
You don't talk to those guys.
Also look out for those Woody's Woody's there, dressed up like Woody the Cowboy.
00 but they got like boners to that is.
That's it.
You're at your you're really hitting Woody's heart.
Mickey, Mass.
Probably his boners to Elmo's notorious boneyard.
Anti Semitic Elmo was my favorite of those Times Square deadbeats.
I used the best.
His name was Adam Sandler.
No relation.
But he was a self hating Jew That would yell stuff about how bad Jewish people are.
Can you imagine some innocent family from Wisconsin who thinks going to Times Square is a great thing to do with your time and money?
And then all of a sudden, this elmo from the mouth of Elmo comes all this anti Semitic nonsense you're paying these people to pose with your children?
These people are like the most dangerous men alive.
Oh, yeah?
Absolutely.
This is like to lose.
Yeah, he's here.
Like they brought all I know.
There could be a cartel assassin under one of those masks.
Hey, Brian, you may have noticed I put a cookie monster costume on your bed.
Get the fuck out.
That's your new role, Brian.
You're my official cookie monster player.
Enjoy Hollywood Boulevard A have a full disclosure.
I can't do Chiana Reeves.
This voice.
That's fine.
Like Oh my God.
Did they get Chiana really thought this episode?
I close my eyes for a second.
I thought he was in here.
Oh, man.
I'd love it if Chiana Reeves came over to my house I'd roll out the good good China, everything.
Hey, you played James Spader for him, that's for sure.
Hell, yeah.
Dude, do not be like, Hey, Chiana, you want to play the lake house?
Let's sit here and write each other letters from the future Dude for that future podcast.
How about him on every single episode?
Oh, man.
Like career retrospective Bryant, Did you sign me up for a podcast?
Goddammit, Brian, I want every fucking episode.
What commitment?
So much for John Wick, too.
So I can't wait for that movie anyway.
We she's living in a squat Quiano finds air there.
She's got, like, some sort of boyfriend.
I guess there's some sort of skater boy e that's hanging out and then this'll.
Dude, this dude is the late nineties in human form and let him have Oh, my God.
He's like a living, breathing pog.
This fucking weirdo.
Oh, my God.
This guy and the new radicals do.
This guy's going to get what you give, man.
Don't give up.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
That's a bass player of Marcie's playground.
Oh, my God.
Well, he does.
I mean, I love reading the subtext I think he's giving this young girl sex and candy.
So he, uh, Spader is like being really aggressive on the street like because it's still Spader and like he's not likable in this movie.
Ladies not know just so mean to everybody.
But what?
It's awesome in what you just referenced where he's being aggressive, what they're doing, like the clock is ticking.
He's probably got a bad headache.
Yeah, and he sees.
There's, like, these beat cops and they're like, You're seeing this girl and like, people are just walking by and he's like, No, that's not how you do it.
That's not how you do it.
You get up to somebody because they hate you.
See this girl and someone's like trying to walk by and he grabs this fat guy like by the tie and get the fuck over here.
You'll see there's a girl like a fucking picture on.
The guy's like No, man.
Hey, no, Italy just runs away.
No see, fellas, that's how you do it.
I want to see more of that from now on.
So he grabs the lead singer of Savage Garden and shakes like a man.
Have you seen this girl Fuck you, pig!
And then there's like, a fake chase.
Oh, yeah, that It's one of several times in this movie James Spader has to run a couple city blocks and gets mighty winded.
He sure does.
Oh, man.
So yeah, he kind of like, shoves this dude up against the car.
And he's like, just get a minute.
You're totally fucked.
Just one s o, they go there, the girl just gets killed.
And now this is when Chiana gets it.
There's another chase.
Now there's a lot of with the start of this, though, I just I have to end it because it's it's two instances of people using things to hit other things that you don't normally use to hit things.
So this 1st 1 is like, this woman is like sleeping.
She has a ah, fire that's burning inside an open box fan because that's how you d'oh!
Is that a euphemism?
No, no, no, no, no, not she's literally You know what?
All right, And so like he comes and she's got music on all fake Tory M o.
Start this entire movie big time.
And he's like, That's some mighty fine music you have there and she goes, Oh, you like it, Let me turn it up And she leans down and she grabs this radio.
And so Max him in the face with a radio.
It's awesome.
But then she's murdered.
She's murdered very quickly.
Brian.
I got hit in the face today with a radio.
Do you know anything about that, Brian?
But this fucking movie you signed me up for, I didn't even read the script.
But you did, Brian.
You thought it was good for me.
You thought would be funny to see me get the face with a radio.
Brian, He's real fucking funny, Brian.
So he's chase.
It's been chasing him.
There's a helicopter that for some reason can't keep up with Keogh.
Light is on him and then, like ya know, in all of his duff like spins and this helicopter where you go and this is it's bullshit because it does.
It does what Dare Devil did last week.
It starts at a random part.
This movie starts at a random part of the movie and then flashes back.
That's what this is because you realize, like a way to second all these police cars pulling up these helicopters, these air like the first shots of the movie.
But it's nothing.
I mean, we're barely halfway through the movie when this happens.
So he gets it another thing.
Your message.
The other thing.
That you hit something with Omega.
Hugo's not gonna abandon whatever cues Chiana is on the run.
He picks up a toilet and twisted through a car with No dude, let me tell you something.
You ever see a guy break a window with a toilet?
Watch this movie and you can add that to your list.
Holy shit, he picks up.
It's a full size toilet.
Breaks this window.
It's pretty cool.
Oh, man, it's awesome.
Then there's an incredibly long car chase that goes on AIDS.
A car chase that, I think Christopher Nolan Still for Batman, Man, it's the same.
There's a lot in this that's still Christopher Nolan's Batman, but like this was kind of reminded me of the Blues Brothers.
Yes, there's a lot of hilariously flipping cop cars in this movie, but man, the most impossible thing, the way this car chase ends, is Cheon Su pulls into like a closed gas station, and he slides the car so that, like the back of the car, knocks out all the gas tanks and gases flying everywhere.
And he's just a fucking pervert like he's not my ex.
C i.
Whatever she's done.
Drivers.
John Wick.
He's a fucking pervert that kills women with piano.
Yeah, he's a pervert that can use piano wire pretty well and takes a mighty fine photographs.
But that's about as far as it goes.
Yes, and so the gases just hemorrhaging all over this lot.
These cop cars pull up Cheon Ooh, he's got the windshield wipers out in the car, which is pretty funny.
His car's getting covered in gasoline.
He takes out a Zippo and throws it like lights it and throws it.
This fire trail goes, it lights up these police cars.
It's a massive explosion.
All these dudes are dead, but the hood of his car sets on fire a little bit, and he just drives off with this car on that against every movie law of physicals.
Once a car even remotely gets online and it has to explode against everything I've ever seen in movies.
Brian, let me ask you, Did you read this ridiculous scene with this car chase.
How is my car not blowing up?
Wouldn't a logical movie to sign me up for?
In secret?
Brian Cut?
It could be eight years later.
Brian, do you know I can't be in the dark night because it rips off a movie I was previously in.
I just lost Batman.
Brian, your actions have consequences.
You can't understand Brian.
Who would he have played?
You have to be to phase.
Oh, he probably You know what?
No.
Because when I realized while watching movie while I love him Chiana can't play Villains know this.
This is weird.
And I was trying to recall if he has played villains and other movies.
Oh, Joseph Gordon Levitt's role.
Oh, the old you know, older than what could he be like?
Jim Gordon?
He's not bad, man.
I'm striking.
That is not fair enough.
Maybe raise out ghoul.
Maybe he's got a matrix cash, but oh, yeah, that's true.
Bane, maybe.
Oh, brighter.
Finally, the role of a lifetime.
You know the GNN reporter who put you know Anthony Michael Hall or or the Tubby do that like ah, the Joker's Anthony Michael Hall.
No, the guy.
That's like, Why should I have all the fun?
Like everyone could go kill this guy.
Oh, the accountant guy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That exactly.
Or maybe the Morgan Freeman.
Rollo?
Yeah.
I don't agree with this mess.
Surveillance Batman.
That's more like it, Mr Rane.
All What if he was Maggie Gyllenhaal in the Dark Knight?
Be nice to Jim Gordon.
He's a friend.
Maybe wasn't like Tony Lister's roll or whatever it was in the hospital on the bow.
God.
Oh, the man.
There's something that makes that movie in perfect.
And it's that fucking horses I, Joe.
Yeah, but if it was candy Oh, we're making it better.
Maybe just doing what you should have done 10 minutes ago could be done of Ah, Jonathan Crane.
Yeah, Yeah, that's that's probably the best.
I mean, you're a good joker.
He's not mad.
No, no Scarecrow, maybe.
Or maybe he could get a pencil through his head.
I think you'd be good at that.
So somehow he evades police officers.
Helicopter is all sorts of shit.
He gets away.
Um, and like, here's something James Spader's like Oh, and like, he keeps calling James better because they're playing cat dressed.
That's hilarious, even, um, I think it's the second time the second leader that gets put on alert in like, every time they go to the media.
And like everything, it's all over TV like Oh, my God, this one ball block.
Yeah, And like at one point, like the media even says, I guess this game of cat and mouse will go another day, like they literally say words cat master, you shouldn't do in your script.
But, um, he keeps calling up Spader, and he's like, Oh, you keep doing that shitty Vietnamese restaurant or like, oh, your apartment is crap.
Did wouldn't you like, Wouldn't you be like, Okay, Hey, FBI agents, why don't you stake out my house?
I want six agents toe follow me around, right?
And if you see anybody else following me around, they sort of have the seed of that idea, though, because they cut to the scene of its its its Spader and Chrysalis at the Vietnamese restaurant.
He's like Chrysalis is like what a shitty restaurant.
This is the worst restaurant in the city, and Spader's like, it's okay, by the way, you think he's watching us right now, Chris Ellis is like, Nah, that he just goes on to complain about how he can't use chopsticks.
Speaking of which, did you guys read that I am Devi trivia?
That was like, It's ironic.
Jube Speeder hates Vietnamese food.
Oh, man.
Oh, the fuck was that about, Dude?
Talk about useless things.
Taking up space on the Internet.
Why?
Why does that need to exist?
And how does that exist?
Exactly?
Better update the trivia listing for the Watcher.
Turns out I hate Vietnamese.
He's doing it right.
Easy veiling the blacklist trailer way Wade Redden would hate Vietnamese too.
Wait, What you call isn't his name Wade Redden Ready?
Ray Reddington.
Raymond Reddington, Reddington.
Our thought was Wade, notes Ray Reddington.
Who's Wade?
The Merc with the nose was red.
Yes, way to Wade Wilson is the Merc with a mouth devil.
Oh, last week.
But he's I think the Red Reddington.
Yes, that's it.
Xev.
Red Reddick.
Wait.
You watch the show actively.
I dropped like unlike like eight episodes behind.
But I don't think Davis existed.
Dire time.
Something tells me his name was spoken sometime before season to start.
Yes.
No, I'm sure I've heard it 7000 times, but I'm not gonna I watched a couple episodes of that show.
I think it's okay.
It was one of those.
Like, I'm watching way too much TV.
That's the position I was in.
My friend said, Goodbye, Reddington.
Whatever.
You let him go off that off the top of Nakatomi Tower?
You know what?
I was, You know, that was happy to pick up, though.
Yeah.
Is that baskets?
Galifianakis Way?
Anderson.
Two episodes and was really good.
It's fucking way.
Anderson is incredible in that show.
He really is.
It's It's I think we're Have you seen it yet?
No, I haven't.
And you know, But I do like, you know, it's important.
Like we make fun of people all the time.
And we're just fat idiots.
Like sometimes people do good shit.
And when Louis does well, good for him.
Good on it.
We're just not in a fucking diving board.
God, I think we're having fun on this show.
We don't actually viciously hate Louie Anderson or Brian Keogh knows pool house for him because he doesn't exist.
Waken hate.
We can actually hate fake people, but any time is talking about a real person.
Maybe aside from Jim Belushi, uh, you know, it's an act we might be coming up to the Belushi in sons, right?
The Belushi sauce.
It's happening, right?
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight.
Will call me a hero.
Show me a hero.
He said that for like, one episode.
It's very subdued before you got to stop fucking with the city of Yonkers thes e shit as he's apparently gonna have a role on Twin Peaks in some way.
You know, you got to stop fucking with the town of Twin Peaks, You piece of shit.
He's confronted Victor him confronting Canadian gangsters.
I thought you were gonna say, Confederate soldier.
He could be anything that happens.
We'll hear the south will rise again in this in the sleepy town of twin being a respecter of the past.
I'm here to remind you Bail Cooper, that, uh, look out.
I don't know speaking, I don't know.
So, uh, one of the things that speeder should totally be surveilling and should know about is that clearly he's gonna go after your therapist?
He's following you.
You know he's following you.
He you know he's gonna follow you to your therapist who happens to be an attractive woman, which happens to be this guy's M O, even though he's clearly a gay man who wants now.
And so.
Here's a bit of bullshit, though.
So there's a scene where Cheon ooh, like Spader gets in an elevator and, you know, you see the big gloved hand open the door back up.
He's weird, like a sabre tooth jacket, and this seems like it's It's like he laid and firmer and looks pretty cool.
And ah, Chianti always looks cool.
And so it counted gets in the elevator, and you're like Old barn, you know?
But what you learn from all of those flashbacks of like Spader running after him when the fire and all that he definitely knows what Chiana Reeves looks like.
At least the haircut, the haircuts, the same.
And this dude gets out now.
Two cannons credit.
He doesn't say anything, but calm on.
You know what this dude looks like?
He gets within like, 10 feet of him.
And, um, what happens is Marisa Tomei is a terrible therapist who not only she's Chiana goes in for a consultation.
He's like, Oh, do you tape your sessions and she's a quiet.
As a matter of fact, I do.
For all my patients are interesting information to know.
We're just to confirm every last one of the and you keep them here for some reason.
In an unlocked cabinet would be that filing cabinet over there if you wouldn't happen to label them all with the actual names of the patients, do you?
Because that would be super helpful, as opposed to using, like patient will number one or some other coding mechanism so that people can't break into it and steal people's deepest, darkest secrets.
Oh, crap.
Let me clarify.
Helpful to you.
You is the only person over that filing cabinet over there which is unlucky, right?
Just to be clear for you.
It's not the labels, This guy, it is John Campbell.
You know, the whole fucking name and catalog breaks in, like, with a credit card practically and just open this up, it steals it and then starts listening to his tapes.
Probably pleasuring himself because it's like, you know, he's talking about Cannery.
Oh, he's talking about me.
Oh, and so the last act of this movie is basically Ah, the last picture of the sends John.
Who is the tea on offense?
Spader is the woman that they killed in L.
A.
Right Did the prequel to The Watcher, The Watcher begin.
The last act of watching begins Is this right?
This woman?
And he's like, Oh, it's that grave that I always manly go to and cry in front of So he goes there Well, because that's the Creep City thing.
And Cheon, who has a point.
So, like James Spader, takes a cab to the cemetery, which, by the way, taken a cab into the cemetery.
Listen, get out and walk like drop me off at these gates and I will walk into the cemetery.
That was weird.
It was a weird There's some big cemeteries out there.
I don't care.
It's weird.
Well, you know, you just started the apology of body.
You shouldn't be paying fares inside of a cemetery.
It's fucking weird.
But so it turns out, can totally has a point here because it's the grave of the dead woman in Chicago and candles like, did you move here to be closer to the grave of this dead woman?
That's fucking sad.
James Spader and what's awesome is gone.
Ooh, very disrespectfully is sitting there with a six or a sing Tao on the fucking tombstone.
Just knocking back a couple of beers, just kind of watching this on the day of a new day drink.
And that's kind of fun.
Dude, I watch this at nine o'clock in the morning and I was like, daydreaming, and that's kind of fun.
I watched this at night, and I was like, Ooh, intimidating mortars.
That's kind of the worst line of the movie.
Is like Sookie on it like you fucking idiot.
You went all the way here for a dead woman is like, Oh, no.
Did you just say it?
You're going.
She loves me.
She's decomposing.
Oh, yeah, Brian, you have to read this.
I thought the script sucks.
Brian, can I tell you that's a bad line?
But there's a line that I feel may rival it for the worst.
You are not my talent agent.
No, just previously in the movie, it means nothing.
But after that whole car chase or whatever, Spader goes on some kind of drug bender or something.
I want to mention it on Lee because it's like Ernie Hudson's only substantial scene in the movie is He's like, you know, knocking on the door.
And Spader's not answering.
They break in and they look around the apartment.
Ernie Hudson finds him laying in the refrigerator like he's on the floor, but his head's like in the refrigerator.
And Ernie Hudson's like, Well, he's ice cold.
And I'm like while he was sleeping in a refrigerator and he's hospitalized briefly, it means nothing.
Zero.
So, um, basically, ah, he's like, all right, I actually, and he's like, you know, in Spader brought a gun.
He's got a gun on you and he's like, Yeah, well, the only way you're going to see your therapist who looks remarkably like this dead woman alive if you follow me on my game of cat and mouse.
So here's what you do.
You shoot him in the leg instantly, and you in your paperwork, you say, like you spotted him and he was running away.
Sure, Yeah.
Obviously you just, Doctor, your police work like everyone does.
Yeah.
Mean, everyone's doing it.
We've all done it.
We we have We all got kicked off the NYPD.
We mention that Where's the prequel?
Siri's So Spader gives him is gone, and they're about to go.
The cheapest thing this movie does, which is amazing, is like they're in the grave ready, gives him the gun and start walking away to do, I guess, key on his car and Quiano fires the gun.
Oh, the screen goes white like, because there's no blanks in the gun.
And he said, Oh, you left it loaded, Huh?
And it's like, Dude, you didn't put a blank in that gun way that the effect didn't work or something.
There's a lot of other isn't supposed to, like, represent, like my my granger going off from that gunshot.
It's possibly kind of that because the other thing that this movie is filled with is late nineties music, video camera filters all over the fucking place.
They've got a lot of that choppy, slow motion shit like strobe effect.
Garbage, 11 dead.
Crash test, dummy.
There were there, were there.
They were in the back of the drag.
Ula.
Sorry.
There's no more room in the Dracula, the crash, death studies.
They're taking up the whole packs a carpool in.
I mean, I'm sure some bad sketch comedy teams done this already.
But Rob Zombie solving mysteries inside the Dragila crash test dummies.
Oh, man, we could make like a fucked up 1990 Scooby Doo mystery team.
Sure they're done.
Drive around in the Draghi.
Let you have a couple.
Weren't there?
Uh, you could have the spider from the sex and candy video.
Is there?
He's there.
Scooby talking everyone.
Yeah, but he's voiced by Danny DeVito.
Bumble Bee Girl is kind of like the oracle.
She's got all the computers back there She's developed.
I'm sorry.
She's Velma.
Right belt, Bumble Bee girl from a penny from Inspector Gadget.
Type of.
I've got all the she's No, she's figuring things.
That Barbie girl from ah, Blind Melon, Right?
Right.
The blind melon video.
Yeah, totally.
We could do this.
Beavis and Butthead are there Another thing this movie loves, which is it's a 90.
Think the ghost of Kurt Cobain pulled.
They pull the mask off.
Also voiced by Danny DeVito or Frank Welker.
Yeah, I heard Welker can do a mean Cobain.
We're on the road, Thio.
No, but the thing that the hideout Yeah, they're on the road to the hideout and we get there and well, this is the car scene, though this is somewhere, it's some weird garbage.
This is where can use, like comes closest to kissing him, just like you know, you like my best friend and my brother and kind of my dad like it's this whole speech and it's kind of awesome because what, like Spader's driving the car in camp is riding shotgun saying this speech and he, like, hits him.
And he's like, You fucking look at me when I talk to you and Spain or looks at him like I'm driving And it's actually a nice pairing because I think that they have decent enough chemistry.
They dio just you needed a movie.
Spader is pissed off this entire time because James fucking Spader and he doesn't want to have to talk to anybody.
That's right.
I think that's why he excelled eso well, doing the voice of Ultron because it was just him in a room.
You never had to meet anyone?
No, I'm sure Human Robert Downey Jr had a nice dinner.
They talked about tough turf for a little bit.
Oh, hey, be a fly on the wall of that really nice restaurant where there aren't any flies in reality And, like, you know, maybe maybe ah r d j give Spader shit about his hair going and there is a gap, but at least I had the balls to let it go.
What are you talking about?
Wait, what are you talking about?
Dude, Is that a rug?
No, I don't.
I just think, Yeah.
Who?
Everybody.
He's gotta be dying.
That's for Shelly.
Well, I mean, look, if Robert Downey Jr actually had plugs or a rug, he has enough money that it would look as amazing as his actual hair does.
So you would never know.
Turns out, Iron Man money gets you pretty good, right?
It does a real hair, so they go inside.
Uh, Marisa Tomei's inside of a warehouse.
This is when we so there's gasoline everywhere.
There's a shotgun mounted at her face is a real It's a mousetrap.
Booby trap situation.
So it's like if anyone opens the door, that's not cheon.
Ooh, this gun's just gonna shoot it to pieces.
You touch that cheese.
The cage is gonna That's right.
Um and this is I guess Spader, like, left his phone on.
So Ernie Hudson knows.
And this is when, like he quiano starts dancing and he's doing like the devil horns on his and duties are human doing the Dragila.
But I can't imagine he's not dead, that he's dancing, that there's any other reason for him dancing other than to kind of try and turn James Spader on just doing Anything for you, My Devil Lord, Do you like this?
I'll stop if you don't just that we try it out, but it's so we anything going on down there?
It's so weird, though it's like Are not good wood.
Are you, like trying to channel Michael Madsen like Dancing with a gun?
Yeah, to a bad song.
Sort of a weird Are you gonna drag you all day?
Little dog, But it's it's It's stupid because, like I realized watching this movie, I don't ever need to see Chiana Reeves danced with John Travolta.
No, it's a weird thing.
It's very weird.
You're just looking at it like, Is that good?
You don't even know?
And then you're like, Should I be looking at that?
It's like staring into the sun and like you get a key on a pissed off because he's like, Oh, you think we have this great big relationship?
You're fucking paperwork to me.
Is that do you know any serial killers are active in Illinois right now?
Five is an incredibly high.
He says five in the city of Chicago.
So it's just like you're just a fucking job to me, buddy.
Was I just a job away?
I was.
Oh, man.
But you've got other gentleman suitors, five fucking serial killers in Chicago right now.
That's a lot yet in mind.
I'm not bluffing, but I don't know what the statistics are.
This is the scene that really reminded me of the Dark Knight because it's, like, all rigged to blow, just like gas or whatever.
All stacked up.
It's, like, ready to light up.
Yes, yes.
Hardware store attendant.
I do need 16 separate cans of gasoline.
Thank you.
Don't ask.
Why is it weird?
You can't buy, like, seven packs of stewed if, ed, but I could buy all this gasoline on this sawed off shotgun without a background check closing time.
Then if that man just came around seven, I do.
Fuck.
Yeah, dude, maybe, uh maybe some Chumbawamba getting that, uh, lit.
Maybe.
Maybe Quiano is his own worst enemy.
Who knows?
He could be.
I mean, the end of this movie is they get into a fight.
Yep.
And that shotgun that that that that wall mounted shotgun comes into play?
Sure does.
It's my shotgun.
It's chickens.
Shotgun ready to blow, gifted in the right.
Now, not on the deck of the Enterprise.
Oh, my Captain.
The floor.
What sucks, though, is Spader definitely just shoots County when, like the leg.
Yeah, not even like the butter that knee.
Like something that will incapacitate you the way you want or the dick.
Oh, yeah.
Shooting right.
The dictum beloved diction that'll do it.
Shoot him while he's dancing.
It is devil who got shot.
The devil horns he faces like they jumped.
The fucking warehouse is on fire.
The big, dumb, like Spader sets the fire, though, because the other thing is and again Maur to this theory that, you know kion has got it bad for Spader.
In this movie, there's all of the gasoline and whatnot, but there's candles everywhere.
I mean, the whole thing is like when these candles burned down, they might get to the gas or whatever.
It's scented, though, but I don't know what.
Like he throws something, Adam or something happens.
And Spader knocks over one of these candles and that starts this huge blaze.
And him and resident may jump out the window.
And, like, Chiana doesn't get out in time.
He totally catches on fire up, and then he jumps out the window.
And this is some spawn level special effects.
Wolf, the CG.
I find it so bad thing.
End of your movie.
This is the most important scene in your movie.
Theoretical.
I honestly thought that at the end, here would be a fight in that in the water down there with Cheon Knew as like a ah Black and Bert scaling tonight.
Then they Jason and the Argonauts like final James Spader.
Well, the interesting thing is, there is no, uh, last act.
We thought he was dead.
Now he's back.
I think Yana was just done like you put a fucking dummy in the water, I'm dead, Okay?
There won't be a twist ending.
Thank you very much.
If you want Brian to do it, he'll do it.
But I am done Suri's fattened has red hair, so he lives.
Nothing like me.
That doesn't matter.
This movie fucking sucks anyway.
No one's going to see it.
As a matter of fact, I remember that I had just started working at the multiplex at the time when this movie came out and you had to do the thing where every Thursday night, like you put up the new posters, was that the other thing?
And so I've just got this, like role of posters that are putting up in the cases, and I didn't know what this movie was.
I think the poster was pretty cool.
I don't see the movie until last fucking night, but in 2000 I was like, That movie looks pretty cool But I put up this poster and I'm not paying attention to you, just like stick in the light box and I close the locket and I stepped back and I look at it.
It's like no one seeing this movie.
It's like cheon ou in a darkened silhouette.
Yes, and he's holding the piano wire.
What?
I was like, Oh yeah, turns out it was no good.
So the end of the movie is the end of the movie like Chiana does not come back for like, there's just like the red skull is in the water.
They make a point to be like This movie is over with cause, like Spader helps get Marisa Tomei out of the water.
And then he swims over to Cheon Ooh, whose face down and he turns him over.
And it's like on It's like All right, yeah, that dude's Day, he's not coming back.
There's no Watcher, too.
You can see the inside of his face, and the last line is, um uh, because it's like they replay the, uh, uh, Dracula that they don't They replace Spinners first conversation Marisa Tomei and write as a therapist.
You know you would, he says.
Time's up, which is really just like yet I'm done with this movie any good night, everyone.
So the editor was done.
He was like, You know a great way to end this.
Just put Time's up.
I'm done with this movie, man.
Like just talk.
It's one of those things where it's like, Why do you want to make this movie?
Why did anybody want to make this movie movies about killers were all the rage and then late?
Not yet.
Late nineties, only thousands.
It was, like way still get a little bit.
But yet there was that post seven.
Yeah, you're right.
Sounds like any kind of serial killer movie Where in the serial killer is cat and mouse ing with someone, right?
And it's kind of sexy.
Definitely wanted to be a little bit sexy.
Little sex.
This movie could have been sex ified by, like, 65% man, you know, like, we weren't ready for it as a country and 14 I was ways to do it, man.
I would have loved for them to get down and fucking dirty.
Oh, yeah.
And Spader's doing like, Is this what you want?
You know, this is what you've always wanted.
Kind of a thing like tricking him.
So like, Tomei can get out of there kind of things You don't mean, Dude, the sex a phone comes and there's no sex.
A phone in the know It's all fucking Dracula's left and right.
Too many drag.
You got to tell you that just worked for me.
Yeah, you know e.
I mean, back then, the value of a Dracula was way, way today.
It was kind of cool.
It was kind of cool to have a drag.
You learn your movie.
I kind of want my funeral.
I mean, like, well, you know, I'll write a funeral when I'm older.
But like, if I write a will wanna Mulder.
But if you want to write it now, if if before I get to it I'd like Dracula to play at my feet I just want, like, just like it's a real stoic Memorial service is a big picture of me, and it's really sad.
It's like Stephen wanted one song to play.
It tired me.
Oh, after before eulogy, Stephen would like everyone does just ruminate on Ah, this song.
You have your permission to put that on periscope police mass live stream that dude, We're definitely gonna have the live stream.
Steve's funeral.
There is an 85% chance I'm gonna listen to Rob Zombie when we leave when I leave here tonight.
Yeah, good idea.
And now I'm gonna think about you dying more so than usual.
More little bit more.
Little bit more.
Haven't seen it yet.
Guaranteed to be better than the Watcher Rob Zombie's 31 coming out this year and fucking pumped for that movie.
Oh yeah, What's that about?
It's about a bunch of people like it's stuck in some leg.
I don't know if it's like a house or a facility or something like that, and there's fucking crazy clowns trying to kill that.
I don't know if I could do that wearing a diaper to the theater like a headless.
I don't think I really liked his last movie.
And I was when you were like, Oh, how something that's so cool.
If you said anything else other than clowns of your like devil people or whatever, I'm like, Yeah, that you like clowns.
No, no, no.
Look, I loves clowns.
Yeah, he loves eerie clowns.
Specifically, would anybody recommend the watch?
No, no, it's okay.
It's, like sort of just such a It's a bit of a time capsule Lee movie.
You can enjoy some of it, but not really.
I actually think this might be an alright hangover movie.
Yeah, my thoughts exactly what it's like.
It's slow, it's meandering.
It's like a detective movie, but you don't really have to pay it.
And you know exactly where it's going.
Okay?
Yeah.
You know, I feel like if you're fucking trash on a Sunday morning, you know?
Yeah.
After you finish listening to that velvet underground Sunday morning, you put on the Watcher and you watch it.
No, Exactly.
Like, if you wake up and you feel like a cat shit down your throat, put on the Watcher and just recover with some gain.
But, um, under no other circumstances now, like, this is not like a get your buddies together.
No, no, no, no, no.
This now, this is hangover bust.
That's the Watcher from the year 2000.
