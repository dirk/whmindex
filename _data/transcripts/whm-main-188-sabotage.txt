But 2000 eleven's The Green Lantern.
Well, I'm like a scorned lover with this movie because I the green lantern he he was my guy and he was always, like the under the under uh, the under the radar guy a little bit.
Is that the fifth most popular DC characters?
I flew the flag high.
Oh, man, this movie's gonna come out.
Everybody's gonna be up by side.
Finally, they'll see what I've seen exactly.
They saw what you saw, right?
Shit.
Remember Geoffrey Rush in that movie?

He plays a fish.
Kind of like a fish green lantern.
Oh, because that's it's like a floating talking fish.
Yeah, Tomar ray, which is like, Oh, yeah, that's right.
You're getting your credit up now.
See?
That's what somebody got a boner out there.
I can't do that with the green land because there's so many alien.

There's way too many do.

Been Eric Cisco, Stephen Saito and we hate movies.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to the program.
Thank you for tuning in.
As always.
I know it's gonna be a good episode when Steve is just laughing at me, doing an intro for no reason.
Hey, tune this and that impression indicates we are doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.
It's a film from last year.
It's called Sabotage.
It's directed by Suicide Squad Helmer David Air and Training Day and End of Watch.
What?
Yeah, he directed Training Day in and Watch.
No, Was Rubs, right?
No, that's no.
They flipped it on you because it's like from the guy who brought you Training Day and End of Watch You.
I think you wrote Training Day and he probably directed End of Water.
Oh, that's entirely possible.
He directed Fury with Brad Pitt.
That's right, Tank.
The movie.
It's kind of one of those things were like the Judd Apatow thing.
You don't even know which one he directed in which one he didn't.
Oh, yeah, from the guy or from the guys that did the they and brush this.
That's a terrible credit.
What from the guy who grabbed from the guy with guys because it's so casual and hilarious because they just have so much fun making those movies.
Well, that actually got me recently with the black hat poster.
And I was like from the man who brought you to the insider's political.
He's just producing.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Nice try.
Black hat.
Michael Mann didn't direct.
Oh, is it gonna direct that Chris helps?
Wait.
Yeah, that that can fall into that category of, like, sexy hackers.
He's a sexy hacker in them.
Maybe him and Sandy can team up and, you know, do something three point out.
Get the hack back, man.
Yeah, The net.
Three point.
Oh, get Sandy back to the French.
There is a two point of view.
She skipped it.
Yeah, she did what we should eventually we'll get to it.
No, I'm sure we'll be watching it for something.
But here today, we're talking about the most recent Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle, which is sabotage, which is kind of like based on a mystery novel, Slick, loosely based on an Agatha Christie Story.
What?
Yeah, which is hilarious.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
I think they're reaching.
I'm sure they are.
Agatha Christie's writing about what?
Juiced up fucking D e a agents, man.
But I don't even know where to begin with this.
Maybe Eric, Do you have a place to start?
Wasn't well, first.
I just wanna do another quick credit.
This is actually written by Skip Woods, right?
Who did Swordfish previous episode and previous episode?
Another another Data does a good day to die hard, which I thought the movie was called Another day to day.
No, that's probably the next one.
That's where he's like, You know what?
Find another day that die hard.
I'm just gonna watch TV or a better day to die hard.
John John McClane gives up the booze, start seeing a lot of eating a lot better.
Or perhaps this perhaps today is a good day to die hard in its Worf And like there's terrorists that air inside the enterprise.
And he's like in the events.
Oh, everyone's detained.
But the security guy I feel like that was an episode of next generation Asian.
Maybe not necessarily Worf, but There was a lot of crawling around in the vents on that show.
Was he wearing a tank top?
I will not put this tank top on.
It's not very honorable for a cling on to wear a tank top.
Then I'd have to have extra makeup on my cling on spine, which happens sometimes I should.
I should clarify, because we said we teased that I would explain Frankenstein's monster.
Yeah, a lot of people are probably like, What?
Yeah, and a lot of people out there I'm with you because I listened to the the episodes that wasn't on it, and I was like, What's what?
It as like, I know what the next movie is.
Am I watching the wrong movie?
He looks like a monster in this movie are towards an Arnold Schwarzenegger.
So many surgeries he looks like he's been patched together by from a bunch of different Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Yeah, there's a couple of different Arnold Point owes in this movie.
You know what he did?
He killed that replicant in that Terminator Salvation movie and took his skin and put it over his body.
I think he may have gone into the plastic surgeon with a picture of him with the cartoon him from that movies.
They just do this.
Make me look like these.
Arnold.
You don't have any facial features.
It's just kind of like a It's a CDO.
Exactly.
That's where movies air going Now use liquid metal.
And plus, I was continuing our monster theme Our unofficial monster theme of 2040 worth 14.
I think it's all the through line.
Seems to be damned Tow.
Walk the earth.
Yeah, I don't run here totally right.
And the dam to walk the Earth in this case is the biggest expendables team rip off of all time.
So we have Arnold and his like, ragtag group of scumbag e ta.
What?
The 80 s e a d e a agents scumbag d e A.
And you know what, folks?
I'm not being crazy.
These people are scum.
They're human scum and all I can do when I'm watching this movie, which I've seen twice now I look at these people and I just think and not the actors but the characters in this film.
If I was in the world of this movie in the same room as these characters at least three of them smell like urine.
Just smell like outright thes air.
Such scumbags.
Folks, you won't.
You won't see this around wherever you are.
Like there's a guy with cornrows, Hair of ready, weird beard.
White guy, by the way.
Yeah, a white guy.
And he's called Grindr.
Oh, man, the nickname.
If you look around the room you're in right now and you don't see a guy think that description, you do it.
Okay.
However, if you find yourself in the room with a grinder, get out of there, just get out of there.
So there is Joe Man Jello as grinder um, Sam Worthington, who I did not recognize this mean A because he's never had a screen presence that's memorable, and B because I forgot he existed and see because he looks like he's running security for Pantera now as monster.
Yeah, he's monster home.
A tripod and hoagie is matchbox tripods, a real war type of the real guy and smoke nube side box and say Iraq's Fira What is great?
It's monster, which is because she's a month peliculas people.
And there's grinder, which is the grinds up your bone and eat them and Lizzie, which is short for Elizabeth because she's a woman and she doesn't get the gold.
Nickname.
Sorry Lizzy, played by Mary Ellie, knows from the killing and World War Z lum it in this embarrassing roll.
Dude, it is outrageous, and I this movie, the misogyny written into this film and like the obsession with penises.
And it's insane to because this is one of those movies with that character of Lizzie has used is she's used as like the well.
It can't be that massage.
Yes, because there is a bitch that's getting in on it with him and just like Jesus.
But here's why.
It's misogynistic.
Is Arnold special like Toby on this team?
You must use your vagina as a weapon.
I want you to infiltrate everything every drug, cartel, an organization of your vagina.
There's, I mean, that's the other thing.
By the way, he does mention they're the best undercover D E a group in the world.
Right?
So they're like the best at doing this.
So much so that merrily knows undercover, like in this drug house, is prepared to have unprotected sex with this drug lord because that's just the job, and the whole thing is like Arnold and the rest of the dudes are like racing to the compound.
And she's got the ear piece and she's doing coke.
She's fucking high out of her mind on cocaine.
And she's saying in the radio like You better hurry up and get here because this dude's about to raw dog it with me.
That's not part of the job description battling that.
But she mentioned.
While it's about almost a raw dogging occurring, the guy mentions, basically, they've been having tons of sex before.
This is just the first time he's run dog.
Yeah, because she's sexually liberated.
Woman everybody All right, which is which is fine in your pipe, Grandpa, This ain't your mama's action movie.
No, it's not.
It's not a movie.
I wanna watch that she's married to a monster.
Don't take your work home with you.
This is one of those situations where you're always like you hear it.
I'm like stern or whatever, like a porn stars like my husband, blah, blah, blah.
And you're like, How could that dude be comfortable enough like married to a porn star?
That's the same situation with this this group.
It's like, Why would you bother to be married?
It's just it's disgusting that the house they live it is disgusting.
Just filth, wall to wall.
The first, their first lines together that lets you know that they're in a relationship.
Is Sam where the kids look.
Looks like you blew the right scumbag and she goes, Looks like I did.
And then they make out and I'm you know, I wanted to walk out of my living room.
I wantto Leo believe by how you put up a sign for rent exactly abandoned by the way, we start this movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger watching a snuff film.
Dude, the fucking all know this is my motivation.
My wife was tortured and murdered my wife and baby daughter.
Well, it's not baby daughter.
It is, son, and I can't stop watching it.
Unlu, because he's just sitting there drinking Scotch, watching his wife get tortured.
And I'm like, Yeah, this is gonna help you work through some shit is big fat dick cigars that he's gotten.
It's about this entire Arnold's on.
This is Arnold's like you have to rewrite that.
What does a bleacher breach creature Preacher smokes the finest cigars.
It's like a Dean Stockwell in Quantum Leap was never the character was not written to smoke cigars, but he wanted to smoke cigars.
But that's what I That's the legend, anyway.
Well, it's also the same thing nowadays with Stallone, too.
Every fucking Stallone character is munching on a cigar from here to kingdom come, but also shoot of GHB or whatever.
That human growth hormone, not GHB.
That's the date rape.
Oops, I don't think so.
Wait, I've been doing it wrong.
That's why you're not getting huge, dude.
H g h is Oh, that's what I'm That's what I meant.
I wasn't trying to make any type of Arnold and Stallone or Beyond h th I think that they're like Nosferatu ing people at this point like that, just like go to Czechoslovakia, suck this like, go to gyms and then, like, suck people's marrow out of their bone.
Well, if you notice, though, after Stallone got caught with it when, like after the first expendables, Maybe that was like a giraffe heart in his bag.
Yeah, crazy.
He's He's definitely, like, gotten small, I guess because I think it's it's either that or that Rambo movie that he did that Rambo movie.
He looks like a goddamn mom star from fucking Space Jam like he's massive in that movie and you're like, That can't be real.
That's like computers, right?
I think it was after that movie.
They were like, You know what, Sly?
We're probably gonna have to check that gym bag.
The whole force just came from seeing Rambo, and we probably have an issue on our hands.
Yeah, but now I mean, with Schwarzenegger, it's even worse because he's he's still doing it.
Obviously, he's juicing to the max in this movie like the rest of the cast, and he's like he got all this face surgery.
So he's just a big walking statue, But he's like fucking door Gollum in this movie.
He's finally actually the terminating.
He did not have a large facial range toe work with as an actor.
No forehand.
Think about the face he has on the like the poster for kindergarten cop or jingle all the way right.
He can't make those faces.
You can do that of a sly smile or anything now, so yeah, she she has sex with this dude or is about to.
The whole team breaks in and they raid this thing.
Get ready for some call of duty violence, everybody shooting, Dude, the language on this movie and also whenever anyone gets shot doesn't matter where, like in the leg or something.
Even it's just like a pot of red Jell O flies against the wall.
The the computer blood is terrible cause they can't do that right yet.
Yeah, it's kind of like when c g I first, like, really started amping up in like, the early two thousands, and they still hadn't figured out like rain and wind and shit, right?
That's where we're still at now.
With blood like this is 2002 looking blood.
Yes, and yet the language is out of control.
And every time we criticize language, I always preface it with I know.
But this movie we're talking about this earlier today, Steve, like their scenes where there's just like shootouts happening and over laid on the soundtrack is just like a motherfuck.
What the fuck was that?
Fuck you do shit And you have no idea who is talking.
You never see it.
You just you never see it.
It's not even when she has happened when they're all like hanging out together those scenes that give me anxiety like, just like you know, the dirt, the filth there's like What the fuck you scumbag?
Hey, man, you're a fucking loser, Bobby Buck Buck.
It's just it's so terrible.
And also mixed into that, too, is a lot of who just ripped Paris.
Like, Why not throw in talking about Bardem cheese farts?
It's like hanging out with a high school football team, you know?
Yes, yes, And these people are 50 years old.
Plus, and it's the other thing where it's like they do this a couple of times where you think two people are getting in each other's faces on their like about to beat the shit out of each other.
And then it's just a laugh riot and everybody Oh, I would fucking with you.
Good motherfucker.
Fuck you, you fuck!
And you're just like, wow!
Wow.
Can everybody stop all of this?
Those are the worst scenes in this movie.
Oh, yeah, when they're all just gibbering at each other and like drinking, having a good time.
That's what happens when you get a room full of guys that all their nicknames and an e r preacher monster.
Oh, wait, we're forgetting an important wonder.
It's not e R.
It's Terrence Howard playing Sugar and the Gus Josh Holloway from lost playing neck.
I think this Arnold started running out of creative.
You appear to have a longer than average neck.
You are neck that's right in the middle of this movie.
Like he's trying to find every like, neck neck.
Well, you neck and I'm like, Yeah, you have no fucking naked the war you bade stir.
But then there's the one guy whose name is just like smoke Jennings.
Yeah, he doesn't make it.
He doesn't make it long when he also just doesn't have a nickname because everyone you think it was born spoke.
No, but it's not like a grinder.
They're like, Hey, this is smoke Jennings.
That guy's always smoking over there.
I'm gonna call you smoke.
Look, Is that the origin?
Maybe, you know, probably smoked meth a lot.
Oh, that could be so.
I mean, I guess the catalyst for this movie is a deal gone wrong.
So they wind up go.
There's a big room full of money, and it's like a breaking bad sized, like money cube.
And you kind of don't know anything about anybody.
All you and you know, everyone's throwing bullshit nicknames at you.
You know, it's like you watch one of the bad X men movies.
Who's that guy?
And they had shoving $10,000,000 down the toilet because it's like they can't walk out of the house with money on them, because at the end of the day, there's still technically law enforcement personnel.
So the idea is, we're gonna tie a rope around all these bricks of cash and put it down the sewer drain.
And then we'll go into the sewer afterwards and get our money.
Sure, But before they could do that, they have to take apart this shit filled toilet as like, you know what, It's bad enough I just had to sit through, like, the fart jokes and all of this going on about Fuck you, motherfucker!
You fucking piece of shit grinder and all of this kind of nonsense, Then to just come to a ship filled toilet and they're all like, Oh, you motherfuck.
Who's at the door that was gonna be filled with gin, and they're all, like, throwing up over it.
And you just have to watch these two men remove ah, feces filled toilet you get.
Are you hire a plumber and you cut him in on the action.
How long it might do us that?
Recruit, Plumber, get idiom.
Plumber, this is Mario.
Mario, Mario.
Mario, Say hello to neck grinder.
Thesis smoke Jennings Animal and the rest of the Muppet Baby, that's just lazy and Lisi.
Sorry, Lizzy.
You'll get your dick name sometime.
Yeah.
Hey, how about Suck Dick?
A lot Could pick their guys because she's of Oban.
They're all equal parts of my team.
So whatever, man smoke Jennings gets killed in this whole thing.
We get down to the sewer and it turns out after another five minutes of fuck, you motherfucker!
Who fucking farted talk.
They discovered that someone has beat them to the sewer and cut the rope and stolen the $10,000,000.
So it's all for nothing.
A smoke Jennings.
I've been double crossed by Mario Mario Smoke Jennings died for nothing.
Now we also there's just really quickly because the massage this movie is it is the most misogynistic movie we've done since the butterfly effect.
Oh, absolute.
This is a level 10 misogyny.
Man is there's like this weird lesbian scene for no reason is a B roll.
Org characters Th's two women going at it like Are you serious?
The movie didn't even start yet.
It's It's before the I'm not wearing a condom moment like he breaks up lesbian sex to get out of here.
Gonna fuck this Coke addled woman.
Now it's just such a It's just like a This is a movie for guys.
You don't want guys like the watch.
Sometimes guys just like to watch movies.
Is that all right?
America?
Can't a guy just watch a guy movie?
Yeah, we're guy murders, 50 other guys and then, uh, abuse is a young woman put maybe sprinkle in some lesbian sex and a shitty toilet.
Oh, grind.
Uh, I need you also, by the way.
Great.
Um, great.
Tough guy named Grinder named after a gay sex app.
Do you think?
Right?
That's why they call of Grindr.
Maybe he's on that ship on the regs.
Know what?
Grindr?
I'm going to tell everyone else on the team.
It's because you like novelty sized sandwiches from Middle America.
Secret Dies with me grind.
We all know the real reason why you have that nickname grinder and I saw your phone So there's no E.
There's no either.
It's an E free nickname and then we get into some white left grind.
So we get into like, the investigation, which is more people like.
It's just like so bloated people, fat people cursing at them for five minutes actually, like it's enough tough guys.
Kirsty getting to the now fat people start cursing at muscular Dude is this is all it's all like, Oh, just like the bureaucracy at the office.
Everyone's upper management fat jokes.
Well, what they don't They don't really explain to you because this movie is terribly put together like you have no concept that, like this team has been dissolved after this toilet incident and all the money went missing like you just see them interrogated and everyone be raiding this team of investigators, which is ah, comically fat man.
And then the dude who played he was on Ah, Angel for a little bit.
He was Fred's father on Angel.
He's in a bunch of stuff he kind of is.
Ah, not Garry Shandling to me like, Oh, nice.
Garry Shandling's, like, uglier younger brother.
Oh, but it says these guys being like, Listen, we're kinda sure you stole $10,000,000.
Where's the fucking money?
You push these, get out, get out of my face with that bullshit, or you want to call me a boozy about that call you a fucking fuck phase.
It is going to continue in a vicious circle until somebody gives up you.
You have 48% body fats.
Just calling out this man's obesity.
And let me tell you something that shuts him up.
Arnold storms out of the room, and those two are left silent.
Well, just like your guys that got some point is like, you know, your dirty copy scent of a bitches.
Yeah, well, your fact, same difference as big A homicidal maniac is overeating around the holidays and listeners at home.
You may think this scene sounds amazing, but it's shown on, like, the shittiest video camera quality ever.
Like this movie thinks it needs to do this aesthetic where you're like watching the interrogation cam like of what the police were filming on at the time.
Yet this interrogation cam has several different angles.
And his edited?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got close ups of Arnold's eyes, like old, back and forth like, Whoa, Did I do it?
Was it lazy or was it was it?
I bet it was secret.
Homosexual grind.
Monster would never do this to me.
I know monsters.
Okay?
Monsters.
You know how much they got his nickname?
Because he loves Metallica's some kind of monster.
He was watching use of Eric that the DVD out were like, Dude, you're like monster over here.
Good.
It's funny image that I work at work today.
I walked by the break room and sitting on the break room table waas some kind of months there, that new movie on DVD through the Never three D movie.
And like one of their older albums, All still in the plastic casing.
Just sitting there all day long.
Not a soul took it.
That's really strange.
Yeah.
Um So what I love also about so like the team is dissolved.
The movie doesn't tell you this.
It doesn't give you a six months later, you find out six months later it's six months takes place because of like, dialogue later in the movie.
But you have no idea how much time takes place, not because the credits cuts this up.
It's like sabotage.
But what's awesome is there's a scene where it's like Arnold is working at a desk and it's him, just like hardcore.
Filling out this paperwork through the cubicle is just amazing.
I think he's got a spreadsheet and he's just got this shirt and like, basically, like, he's still going to work and everyone tells him not to go to work like this.
Boston.
Move your fucking joke, Schwarzenegger.
Your creature.
You can't even fucking You can't even do formulas, right?
You be shit.
That's what I love in this either.
Because that guy, like, spouts a bunch of nothing.
And Arnold's just like, Yeah, well, we'll see what the investigation turns up.
And then it was like, this awkward silence and the guy just goes, You will fuck you, Reacher.
Its walks also awesome.
Also outside outside of idols like Spanish Villa that he lives in there.
These two cops like trailing him and stuff on.
We have to have this edgy dialogue e scene where these two guys were like, I'm not gonna piss in those bushes.
Oh, yeah.
Bridge is gonna kick my ass if I piss in those bushes again.
All right?
There's a stakeout like they're all being tailed.
You know, we don't know this because we only follow Arnold through all of this.
And, yeah, it's these two FBI agents that are, like, bantering about like the one guy's got to go to the bathroom on the stakeout and the guy's like, piss in this jug And he's I'm not putting my dick where your dick was.
And then, like, Arnold comes out, stop piecing in my bushes.
I'm goingto work that went on for a while.
There was just like, Well, I bet your dick couldn't even figure, you know, Your problem is your dick would fit in that thing too easily.
Like it's like going back and forth about dick girth.
And you know what?
We never see those characters ever again.
We never see their dick girth.
We never get a full measurements show.
Don't tell.
So Martin, the ghost of Martin Donovan, invites of it to his office and is basically like, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck!
By the way you're back on the case.
It's like you've been reinstated.
Hey, actually says you must have a picture of a senator fucking a goat or something.
Breach?
Because you're back out the case, motherfucker.
Okay, Everyone in the world talk like this.
It's I was like, Dude, you are like a commanding officer.
The d e a.
This this conversation might be recorded for quality assurance.
Come on, you're talking about goat fucking Okay, I'm going to round up the rest of my team whose somehow in a big house together is sleeping on bunk beds.
I guess, Dude, it's like the most disgusting the real world has ever been.
Yeah, like the MTV show, the real world quarters.
Like when those people get all scuzz ified on those shows.
Just living in a house.
Imagine it with these people.
People named Monster and grinder and Liz.
Oh, I got this picture that you thought that toilet was full of shit before when the stuff that's around this one, a couple of dudes or playing call of duty, which is awesome, or some like shooting game.
Oh, yeah, I do.
Because you know what?
You've got to stay sharp We might be grounded, man, but doesn't mean I can't get a couple shots off in the V our world.
Oh, man.
I got this code where I could fly drones in Iraq with my with my X box.
Oh, no, no, Lizzie, you wouldn't like this.
You can't sleep with anyone in this game.
This is for shoot.
No.
Only then Lizzy's like, just boxing a punching bag that's just in the middle of this room.
I would fuck with your dick.
How you buried, too, that I'm like, Aren't you guys friends?
Well, that's that's the thing.
Everybody loves getting this close to fighting with other also, and then you just start laughing.
There's something.
There's a little bit of tension because, you know, start like, grander, starting to suspect that some of you guys might be in on that missing money, like because they had the d A brass breathing down their necks.
So we're told we don't see any.
It's all Arnold for 20 minutes exactly, but it's like alluded to, I guess, And then it's just like monster has a line later on.
That's like like you you know what, preacher?
We're not We're not a team anymore.
That's a problem.
Work, gang.
Now they're acting like we're a part of a gang.
By the way, there is a three hour cut of this movie, so that's that's That's a real thing.
Yeah, that really is missing details.
The original draft of this movie that David Eyre turn did was three hours of these idiots cursing at each other.
And of course, the company was like, No, supposedly there was.
There was more mystery and nuance.
It was more, you know, more than mystery thriller.
It was present in that bag of the Gresty book.
I'm talent.
It must have been dead on.
Oh, here's my magnifying glass.
I'm going to follow the clues.
Also, other odd closer inspection.
It appears that I'm wearing loafers.
Also can't forget in this scene While the PlayStation is happening, the boxing is happening.
Everyone is smoking inside this house.
Uh, grinder is giving an at home tattoo to pyro.
Yeah, and it's something like throw Siro, dude Pyros.
The dude it feels like micro a bit.
Does he look like micro know who's the dirty work?
That's Mike Ray looks a bit like so he's getting this tattoo words like a skull.
And then, like he's drawing his spine like down his spine, which is somehow a tattoo.
That is a tribute to smoke Jennings, by the way.
Sure, and everyone comes into the gags like, Oh, hey, grinder, white drone a dick on his back and we have smoke.
Stick that smoke.
Jennings Dick.
You have respect for that dead dick, but it's just it's another gag.
We're running four times, like you know Oh my God, why you draw a dick on his back?
And he's like, Dude, does it look like a dick, Get me a mirror And then like Arnold comes in, he's like, What the hell is going on in here?
It's like a frat house.
It smells like garbage.
Why do you have a dick on your back?
And you're like, Uh oh, Arnold rounding out the joke, you know, that was like they say, like, Oh, Scarface had, like, 200 instances of the F word.
Whenever this movie is just a dick.
Yeah, not only that, but it's got 1000.
Dixit does have so many dicks omada your dick Who's dickwad IQ?
Lizzie's dick.
Okay, you you crumb bums get off your bottoms.
We're going to start trading now because we're back on the case and we get this training montage at this training montage was kind of hoping for the movie to turn into this thing where it's like, Come on, the D A contest is coming up next week.
We've got we've got to get ourselves back into shape.
We have to beat the red team in the obstacle course.
We don't get our badges back.
So the challenge.
So come on, Grindr.
Basically taking like a plot from, like, police academy, like do that?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Way better than what This devolves it all.
Lizzie, you blew Commandant Eric Lassard just like Mahony did at the end of that movie.
At least it was alluded.
There was right thought it might have been Mahoney blowing him, but it wasn't now clarified that Steve Gutenberg doesn't do that.
They think he does, though, so we've got, like, a training montage where it's all grinder.
You didn't check the corner you're doing.
These are inappropriately.
You're supposed to be a team right now and they, like, totally blow it or whatever, because someone didn't check behind the door.
Yeah, And so then that's when Sam Worthington he gives this whole speech about, like, you know what, Arnold?
Because he's like, really bad at covering up his Australian accent.
We haven't gotten to the worst accent yet.
We'll get there.
Oh, it's really bad.
And he's like, he's like, all right, our no holds, you know, thing about bay.
You know, team is that you know what?
We're a gang and Arnold's.
Wow, those are some powerful words.
Months.
I'm going to give them some serious thought before we run.
This training exercise can emergent Every morning when Sam Worthington was getting ready for work, he's just like in his apartment and, like, it's all like Michael Mann blew in the early morning.
And he's, like, on the phone with James Cameron.
Like, you think that script's gonna be done any time?
Do I really have to do this one more day?
You're really taking your time with these new Avatar movies aren't yet.
You want him to be perfect.
I know, but I'm dying out here.
It's cold out here, Jim.
I'm making a fucking movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
You remember him?
You know why, David?
It is it's a monster.
I don't know why.
What in mask.
We'll use Rose's neighborhood avatar.
Oh, David or Chef?
Yeah, she said.
Ted, avid czar.
Could have been Ted.
Have a target.
I could have been that Does the end of that first avatar round off with him deciding to be a tall, blues world creator forever?
Yeah, I want to be this guy forever, And it's like this stupid magic that lets him do it, even though it's a technology man.
That movie's terror Now, now, now, now weaken interlock his braid into lady braids and have mindset.
Hey, Lizzie, I'm gonna lock my braid and my goatee braid, which I totally have in this movie.
Dude, he looks disgusting.
I mean, they all look disgusting, but he looks disc gusting now, if that makes any speaking of disgusting, the plot has hits a standstill because we got to go to a strip club because we work hard.
We play.
Those were man in.
This movie is for man.
Dude, there is some line where Arnold's like now we have to go.
It's something like it's not this, but it's like let's go pray at the altar or one of those things and he says whatever that line is and then someone look strip club Just so the audience was aware before we instantly cut to them in a strip club.
Yes, and like everyone's having a great time.
And it's more B Bob.
They get into a fight with a bouncer, like how fucking white trash or you?
It's because they will fight with a bouncer.
It's even worse, though.
It's because Terrence Howard is like, You know what?
I could dance better than you guys and he gets up on the pole and starts.
And then the bouncer comes over like, Hey, could you not harass an assault?
Are dancers and then grinder Joe Manganiello comes over?
Oh, yeah, motherfucker.
And they just get into a big beef fight.
Hey, swipes left right across his chin.
The guy goes down.
I think they killed him.
I think that bouncer's kill and then it Sze this dude might be dead.
And then it's like, Well, time to get out of here, I guess you know, like how many times do they have just done that?
Originally, you could have just walked out, but no, you had to punch him.
This is my favorite scene.
What's coming up now is basically a pyro wakes up in his trailer because this movie is exactly the white trash godfather.
Yeah, or in this case, the white trash, The fugitive of God.
He wakes up and he's like, Oh, man, I gotta take a piss.
He takes the pants and he's like, What's that?
No, I think you think the piston is sync, by the way, does he?
I think it's in a sick in his trailer.
You know, sometimes you got to do it.
It's a pretty nice trailer.
T be honest.
I thought it was an RV, isn't it?
Oh, I guess it is.
Yeah, it's a Winnebago because he tries to start it, and it's another of the 1000.
What the fuck?
Like when the car doesn't turn over and basically somebody parked his R V on it.
Padre drags.
I'm like against glued the door shut or something.
We never know.
He just tries to open a door and it doesn't open.
And if you set your beefcake, break the window and get out of there.
Exactly.
And he doesn't do that, and he doesn't.
He doesn't even move to the rear of the vehicle.
He just he just like how there's drinking right at me, Odo.
And he's looking right at the light coming at him, and it's like Woody at least moved to the end.
Well, it's Either I leave this trailer and live or baby, I have enough time to get by seven dust bootlegs out of here.
Better wait, save these original boots.
Maybe if I stiffen up because I'm such a real tough dude and I stayed put that I'll break that train.
Hey, you know what?
I'm going to stand my ground with this drain.
This train's not covered in to buy a house so he gets annihilated by this locomotive.
Not surprising.
And now enter.
I think me really knows is a great actor.
She's great on the killing, and she's really slumming in this movie.
Yeah, but Olivia Williams wins the slumming it Holy Toledo.
Like a long way from Rushmore.
She is a better class of actress than this movie could ever dream of having, and I don't know if there was like a year of prep school that she needed to pay for getting the driveway.
Don the house recited like I know people have toe work, but what was going on that you had to do this movie because you didn't want to do this?
Milk?
Phyllida, something in your life made you do this movie, and that is fascinating to me.
And I think this is the worst female written role of the new millennium.
Like since fucking since 2001.
Since 9 11 this is the worst fie vel written role because it's not a female written role.
It's clearly a thing where it was just a ball bustin dude like the rest of it.
And then someone like some executives somewhere was like, You know, we better have more than one female character in this movie.
The strippers don't count cause they're kind of just extra.
What about that Lesbians?
There's two right there.
What tripped it down?
It used to be an hour.
I want to make it my three hour cut TV fare.
His wife is a character who only exists in torture Flash fact.
That is true.
I don't see why the lead detective has to be changed to a woman.
I watch a woman get tortured and murdered on film four times in this movie every day, Preacher has to struggle with playing, pressing play on the snuff tape to see to see his wife.
It's one last chance to glimpse upon his beauty.
I mean, I guess we're doing a lifetime movie, fine maker of woman, because she also and it's not even when she's trying to, like, talk up against Arnold.
It's also and his clan of idiots.
It's also when she's like, just at the office with her partner, who's played by Harold Paranoia, also from Lost.
And she's just like trying to do this Southern accent.
If you know what, why don't you try to suck my dick, too?
And you're like, Wow, Olivia Williams.
I mean, it's a bad Southern accent.
I think it's probably because she's not trying at all because she hates this movie.
Oh, yeah, it's It's the worst accent because I have a feeling If Olivia Williams wants to do a Southern accent, she's gonna do a Southern accent, and instead she's doing a chicken fried Foghorn Leghorn voice, and it's a horrible hears things like I was reading about this after the fact that e I guess it's like it takes place in the Atlanta area, right?
Which is the one thing I will give this movie credit for.
Shot on location in Atlanta.
And they just said it, their eighties movies, words like we're gonna film in Atlanta and for whatever reason, it's passing.
Is Seattle.
I say up the Atlanta in this movie because I felt like almost could have been any town USA.
You don't know it's Atlanta until, like the middle of the moves.
I'm on Atlanta law enforcement agent.
That's that's generous with her Southern accent sound.
So she gets on the case.
And, like Arnold's words, finger come is like Oh, no, what happened to my man?
He's always gets the call he does, because you don't Well, you don't know what his deal is like, how he's getting these calls really like, Is it just long fortunately for each other?
Or is he in on it?
Who's sabotaging?
Who in this does a sabotage there?
Some, Some.
They're in here.
There's a sabotage.
This appears to be the work of a saboteur.
I'm going to put that out there.
I'm going to find them, and I'm going to crush it with my hands and Harold Paranoia was, is like, you know, it's like, Oh, man, that's the best D agent in the world.
You know who that is?
And, like Olivia Williams to endear herself movies like, Well, why don't you just go suck it Ban?
Well, congratulations.
Well, you'll fit right in fine here.
Olivia.
You have no problem saying this line.
Sound familiar of another Skip Woods written screenplay in which Halle Berry says the exact same thing?
Yeah, how you're totally right.
I'm Skip Woods.
And that's just how I think I write powerful women.
They like to throw it back in my face when I talk to them about sucking Dick So they got.
Now they say, Silken dick.
Clickety clack.
Motherfuck.
Quickly clack bang bags.
Skip Woods.
Oh, man, my my keyboard looks like a bunch of guns.
I got it.
Special ordered man looks like a couple of Glock tens.
Every word.
That type is another bullet in the heart of the enemy, and the enemy is conventional motion pictures.
Now the enemy is the audience, so she's on the case of this great train explosion, and she's like, Well, I have to interview the team.
Let me go to Pyros Memorial Service, which is at Arnold's Villa.
As thing is Gore, it's like this beautiful lake house.
It's insane.
Yeah, the whole question is, who took the money?
Arnold took the money.
If he's got a d e a agent, he's got this fucking house that's built on a cliff, sees the rest of them live in a club house together.
That sub par for the real world.
And this place looks like the Mexican Cartel Mansion.
But it's in America, so it's worth even more so.
She opens the door and listens like, What are you, this stripper?
Get inside and it's like, shut up movie.
It's It's a big shut up movies.
She's like strippers here.
Shut up!
Why would you hire a stripper for smoke?
Whatever his name is, Smoke Johnson was pyro.
Now it's piracy, and I said they're dropping like flies because Pyro loved him.
Some strippers he remember we punched a bouncer.
Woods.
Oh, right.
That happened 72 hours ago.
And she gets into it, you know, just trying to get everyone trying to get, you know, quotes for, you know, her investigation and grinder gets in her face.
And it's a white trash distinction of almost raping a woman at your best friend's memorial service.
Like That's like we had a trick.
He would have wanted it that way.
Yeah, Fira would have wanted it that way.
It's this, like, chain of intimidation that starts with Lizzie What she's given Also.
And the funny thing is, Olivia Williams character is like, Listen, this is an open and shut case.
He was drunk when we found the booze, you know?
He just fell asleep.
We got hit by the train.
It's open and shut.
I just have to have a statement from the last person that saw him alive.
Like this is gonna take two seconds, and they're like, You want to get out of our fucking face with this right now?
What are you trying to prove?
What are you trying to do?
But you're cops, and she's a cop.
Like what?
About some solidarity.
And then they're like What?
Well, why don't you have a beer than if you're gonna be here?
And she refuses, and then they go off on this tirade.
I can't even recall what you're telling me You don't want a beer.
This is Power Rose Memorial Service.
You will drink this Paps blue ribbon that I am forcing in your fucking face right now and she takes and she's like, Yeah, Kai old have this bill and she opens it and sprays it face.
And it's like he's like, That's how I like it and gets ready to do this.
And then Arnold, look, stop it.
This is my house.
Stop acting like animals.
So our love is like All right, listen, if you leave right now, because no one's gonna hurt you were about to tear you limb from limb for no reason.
If you leave right now, I will make sure tomorrow because she wants to talk with neck.
Yeah, he's like he was like, I will bring you to see neck tomorrow night.
Just leave right now.
Doorbell rings.
There's a woman mayor, and she's like the stripper.
It's the stripper, huh?
And she says something about like, Oh, they don't tip very well.
And Arnold like ha ha!
Get in here.
The stripper here.
Alright, put away those cheese farts.
You could put paws on this episode because we haven't talked about Arnold Stupid haircut yet Oh, yeah, I'd be.
Let's get into it.
He looks like Macklemore, his grandfather.
It's like nobody should have no one over the age of 40 should have this haircut.
He looks like the guy in the sea Alice commercial that's about to start a rockabilly band, all right, Like it's like, Oh, look how young old people can be these days.
That's exactly what it is because it's like when I have to be able to run with all these for these something d e.
A.
Agents interval.
To be fair, he's got It's an authentic Austrian here like J.
Edgar Hoover.
If you gave him gamma radiation, I'm now super Who?
VA.
I can't see my movie.
Super, who've are starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as the mutated J.
Edgar.
I am having a great time spying on Dr Martin Luther King Jr as Super Hoover in the Super Hoover script.
They wanted to put in the cross dressing, but I threatened to walk.
You'll never see me wearing a dress.
I was like, though it's not.
That's not the kind of movie we're making.
It's more like Intimidation game, where we put all that shit in the box and forget about it.
You mean the imitation?
Although Intimidation game is what they would call imitation game if Arnold starred in the movie Oh, my God.
The greatest crossword puzzle ever is beating enigma Edvard Enigma The Germans have.
I think that would be a tough one for Arnold either.
Like you sure is on our side.
Yes, I would love to beat the Germans.
I am Alan touring Kiera Knightley.
Let us get married.
I am all for these lavender marriage, Kiera Knightley.
It was surely benefit both of us.
I will only say that I am homosexual.
Two or maybe three times on it will be referred to off screen.
And it will be a huge food for the F B B D community.
What a hero I am for doing this movie coming this Oscar season.
If the intimidation game Oh, mercy.
Anyhoo, uh, deck gets stapled to the ceiling.
Oh, wow.
It's.
And let me tell you, there's a couple of things that are really embarrassing for a person when you're at work.
Okay, So, like, if you are, if you're like, you know, working in, like the restaurant business like you're you're a table server you know, and you drop a plate of food mercy that's embarrassing.
Or like you're taking your gender and you're taking out the garbage in the bag of garbage Just for that.
No, that's embarrassing.
If you're a homicide detective and you're walking in a house and you slip and bite it on a pool of human blood in the dark, Really embarrassed she goes down in this movie.
Yeah.
Oh, Olivia Williams just falls in this man's blood pool and she gets up in Arnold's like Do you want?
That is, You has.
She's like dripping with the blood, and you can tell she's so humiliated.
She's like, Just just get me out of here.
They hung neck from the ceiling.
They skinned, um, took the predator, and it's a thing where they're like, Oh, like she makes the connection.
Oh, I've noticed that the year accused of ripping off this drug cartel, I know a bunch of drug cartels that nail their victims to the ceiling or to the wallet.
Before she had, she had seen the video where he yells at the fat guy.
It's just it's my favorite part of the movie.
You could actually search at YouTube.
I think it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger yells at fat people or something.
It's a good time, you know?
Arnold yells at fat.
You'll find it.
That's a good That's a good combo.
Um, and I mean, we kind of just skip forward.
Who else is, Really?
I mean, the reason this is based on the adequate.
The Christie novel is like and then there were none.
Because, like every scene somebody's getting killed or like right this big mystery about who got it, who done it?
It holds on it.
It's a really Arnold Schwarzenegger who done it.
Sabotage and Arnold Schwarzenegger mystery.
Uh, by the way, the Beastie Boys refused to let the music be used in this movie.
God bless, which I love it, Adam, you in his will and before this, too, before he passed away.
The Beastie Boys always did this, but in his will stated that for ever in perfect Judy, the Beastie Boys music would not be used to sell things, so they wanted to put the sabotage in the trailer, and it was like, Nope, you're barred from doing this four ever.
Which is that is some beautiful integrity from the Beastie Boys, man.
God bless, but I just What is that meeting like, right?
It's like So listen, we know that you famously, uh, never allowed anyone to do this, but well, it's for the new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.
Yeah.
Get out.
No, no, Hear me?
We got the poster's done on everything.
We can't go back on that.
We can't go back on sabotage.
It just had to be sabotage, even though that's not really what's going on.
Yeah, it wasn't the original title either.
It had two different original titles I read, which were 10 Good one on Creature, a breeder.
Each other movie while I start has Jack Reacher, Jack.
But, oh, you know what they bothers from using the rights.
But unfortunately, Mr York forgot about the Carrie.
Okey writes.
I will sing it now I'm telling all the old is the Sabbath eyes, right?
Right about the heads.
It was the It was the best loophole in a contract I ever found.
I don't know.
I think this is the seat.
This is my food.
So she's like, really up against in this investigation.
She's like she's suspecting Arnold because he's always there at the wrong time, etcetera, and ah, Sam Worthington shows up and goes like, you know, there's something you need to know about Arnold.
There's this really cool back story, and it's like this useless thing about how his wife and kid were kidnapped and killed on and visit.
His son is in one scene where he's like, I love your dad and he's like, Oh, I love you to Assad and isn't there, is there or is there not the tossing of a baseball?
Thereby There might be.
Look, we're father, son.
That's all it takes to create the bond.
You know, you get the rest of the idea and yeah, his wife obviously gets kidnapped and raped six ways.
God knows what and murdered.
And you don't worry, they do specify all of that garbage.
Oh, yeah, They tell you everything.
Oh, they took her eyeballs.
That this They say that our we're not cartel mailed pieces of her toe Arnold and the son of both of them pieces of both of them.
Four weeks x on.
And you know what, u S P s stop that shit.
You know, like, honestly another another delivery from Mr Breacher, Another blood soaked envelope for you.
Have a nice day, sir.
Whatever Meat Club you signed on to really paying out the spades, you know, it's hot today.
Your shipment of I'm guessing Omaha steaks all they smelled so good on the ride over, I think they might have cooked a little.
No, it's just my wife's leg and then they sleep together, which is, I mean, this won't do We know about this character is that she's a hard nosed investigator and she just wants to get the job done, et cetera.
It's just no other character traits.
Olivia Poor Olivia Williams is naked in a pool for five seconds.
There's like a topless shot.
This is the most terrifying scene in the movie because, like night swimming already kind of freaks me out.
But now I have to contend with if I'm swimming at night at one point, Arnold Schwarzenegger may mysteriously be standing on the side of my pool because she just is like swimming and drinking wine, by the way, Very dangerous effort.
Time to breach the subject.
And it's just like then she's in a bathrobe in the house, and she's like, you know that story that monster told me earlier.
Well, it got me incredibly aroused because there's no other explanation.
Oh, it doesn't like, you know, he looks like a monster, you know?
And it looks like Frankenstein's monster.
Yes, he does.
Using Adam Frankenstein, although not as good.
Know what?
Actually, if Arnold Schwarzenegger played Adam Frankel had better movie wait better, more accurate to it would have been better.
He's like, Yeah, that dude is made from a bunch of different dead parts and Arnold knows cheeseball, you know, Internet could wandering around lost, You know, you should switch the two rows because Arnold doesn't belong in this movie.
That's like the biggest problem is like just doesn't belong in it.
It's not the kind of role that Arnold can play anymore.
No, you know what I mean?
Because at 70 years old, he's not doing this kind of work anymore, though he's not, it's it's called Mandatory Retirement Gang.
You're not running around with the D.
E.
A.
At 70 years old, breaking up cartel.
How about take a page from Eastwood's book?
Start directing these pieces of shit you directed that dumb ass movie Christmas in Connecticut?
You can do it again.
Yeah, he really had me.
He failed hard on that one, and he never He never went back, but he needs to get back in the directing chair.
It's just like that's why I think the movie.
What is it?
The last stand?
Yes, that's a way better.
Like Twilight of his action superstar career.
Our old movie, that is when I sparkle because that's like a Here's a dude.
He just wants to be a small town sheriff like no funny business.
And the funny business comes to him and he has to do something about it, like against his will.
Kind of this movie, this character is like seeking this shit out.
And he's the best of the best of 85 years old.
Exactly.
He still continues to be the best of the best.
At least have it be You think there's not one mention in this movie of I'm getting too old for this shit.
Why don't you retire, old man?
Like there's none of that.
Lizzie, hold my teeth.
I'm going into battle.
I'm going to bust into this crack house now.
Please take my dentures into the door is breached.
Oh, I'm at Olivia Williams House.
Good thing I had my see Alice today.
Also, he definitely goes over there solely with the intention of having sex with Oh, sure, there's not even any kind of like, I thought of some new information about your case and I had to rush right into your backyard to tell you there's none of that.
But he's also playing both sides because the next scene, like, I guess what he put a bug on her something like they find out they find a lead in the case about where the cartel might beak.
They're convinced it's the cartel at this point, right?
And they they're gonna they're gonna breach their own house with SWAT.
And he's like, Not not on my watch.
I'm going to get the gang back together.
Yeah, What is that like?
She, like, calls him or something because their leg I've got a buttered up like they're like boyfriend girlfriend wear.
Now, if usually in what I like to call a long term relationship, it's just like like no, let me know and, you know, stuff's going down and then she does.
And then he's just, like, kinda neck.
We're going my girlfriend told me where the next bus is going to be.
Let's suit up.
Let's ruin her credibility immediately.
We just had sex 12 hours ago.
It's time to stop ruining this woman's life.
What's awesome, too, is the morning after, because to this movie's credit and maybe to Olivia Williams credit or also possibly this is just a deleted scene because it was 48 minutes long.
There's no actual sex scene in this.
I don't even kiss.
Thank God, no.
It's like Wish I saw that.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Because it would be weird and different.
Do you think?
Do you think she said no to the whole print?
Maybe was in the script or lead?
She was just like I'm not doing sex scene with our own sports.
Maybe that was the trade off.
All right, I'll take my shirt off in this pool.
You get that if you want, You fucking pervert.
But I am not touching that man.
Isn't I mean, who knows?
Any of these things is possible?
It's all in play.
But the next the next scene is Harold.
Paranoid picks her up for work and she comes out and like he sees Arnold's truck or like because he doesn't see Arnold, I don't know.
But he just know.
And he's like, Did you definitely have?
You did Well, here's your coffee, and our relationship has changed forever.
By the way, you're off this case and you're under investigation.
Just slept with a suspect that you You think that this dude maybe murdering his own team and you slept with him?
Bad decisions got the best of you.
This movie needs, like amusing end credit sequence where, like you it's sort of like fair spillers Day off.
We get that scene of Ed Rooney going on the bus at the end in the credits her like like just like not giving a shit, walking around, writing tickets on cars.
Oh, yeah, yeah, she's been demoted.
She's just a meter reader.
I think we should be in the slammer.
I'm not lying to you.
Yeah, you know, we'll get there, but it's entirely possible.
It just is long scene where they're just busting into houses and like, harassing people.
Yeah, it's this whole like neighbor.
It's like a housing project.
They're just running through from, you know, house to house, sometimes killing people that drawn them leaving the kids alone thankfully.
But it's just another scene of Get out of the way, motherfucker.
Hey, lift up that bed, you fuck and fuck face and just like 20 minutes.
And she says that she's like, What the fuck you know, and like, then grinders like hair cleanup on aisle three?
Well, yeah, it's great because, like, they're looking for the specific cartel, which you could tell by the tattoo or whatever, right?
They killed it.
This gang, like this horrific shoot out and then Sam wanting to look Coop no tattoo.
And they're like, Oh, well, by we're walking out of this huge homicide.
Talk to you later, and it's so awesome.
It's I I would like to put out there that this movie alone could fully stock a brand new a 100% brand new Arnold soundboard for the Internet, and one of my favorite ones that would have to be in there is like they're all walking out grinders like a cleanup on Aisle three, the rest of you pig cop, and then they all walk away, and she's like, What are you doing here?
And he's like, Oh, just you know, our job or whatever it is.
And she's just like she's like, How do you even, like, think that you can do this?
On whose authority?
Or whatever he just goes?
I'm a fed.
See?
Ah, just walks away from left to clean up this bloodbath.
Because, as Terrence Howard points out, they killed six people for nothing for absolutely nothing but no repercussion.
What, Are you kidding me, dude, like you just wanted your murdered, all these people.
There's a guess what that investigation is back over that fat guy that you harassed.
He's got something else to do again.
You're going to see that guy first thing tomorrow morning.
The fat guy and his weird looking partner.
They're both back assigned to the case.
And then at this point, Olivia Williams starts putting together that somebody on the team.
It must be doing it because it isn't this cartel, for some reason.
And then, like, immediately, they, uh, the, uh which Lizzie and Sugar and Sugar reveal themselves at the villains.
Just by the way, in case you're wondering, it was the black guy and the woman the whole time Spoiler alert.
Well, there was a great screenplay.
All those of us they reveal that they're sleeping with each other.
Yes, they have this big like we're gonna meet in the middle of the night and they're like, So who's you know who's doing this?
It's clearly one of us.
It could be any of us.
You know who knows what's going on?
Grindr has to throw in a you bitch.
Jesus!
Oh, my God!
All right, that's how we're talking everybody.
And then she's like, I don't know if this is gonna help the situation or hurt it.
But while my husband monster is here, I've also taken a lover with co workers Sugar and and then it just launches into this tyrant, you motherfucker!
Big, remember, burp.
It's the Jerry Springer shit is that is exactly what's happening.
Dude, you should have hired Stone Cold's to Boston to place Steve the bouncer from Jerry Springer.
Yeah, why not?
How didst don't go out stone cold?
Not in this movie.
That's that's a big problem.
This is a movie where stone cold Steve Austin plays Breacher.
That's believable to me, Not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I could believe Stone cold Steve Austin running around with these bunch animals.
Not Arnold, not a 70 year old Arnold.
Who's that Kraut eyes that ever coming up?
Yeah, because he's the boss.
He's and he's John.
Whatever.
Probably Calhoun is a bullshit John America.
I rather this was like the fourth or fifth time he's played a character named John.
Oh, really?
It should really be a Johan by.
Yes, it should.
My favorite job by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
That could be afraid.
Fragrance or John by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
It smells like blood and shit.
It was John Matrix in Commando.
That is a real Easter matrix.
Hello, I missed The Matrix.
I'm your substitute science teacher for the day.
You got any great war stories?
Yes, I have a few of at this point.
You know, Lizzie And you know, Lizzie in sugar now, outwardly killing people Grinder goes to the cops and, like, you know, Arnold again is he bounces between like being this woman's best, Olivia Coleman's best friend and Knots, which is like Williams, Olivia Williams.
Olivia Colman is definitely not being in sabotage.
Thank God for that American breakout opportunity or no.
So, uh, there, there there's this diner and then grinder gets shot in the head.
It's like Who cares?
Well, yeah, but guess who the trigger man was?
That's when I think they reveal.
I don't think they reveal the parking lot seen.
It's when grinders like All right, I'm gonna tell you bastards everything.
Step one, I need some tequila and his brains all over this diner.
And then she keeps fucking pumping him full of bullets like Arnold.
Get down, love.
Ah, and then it's like, Oh, my God, who's doing the killing?
And it's like Mary Alina's with, like, a sniper rifle, and she's really just blasted him.
It's just this corpse.
It just keeps getting hit.
This is the most interesting scene in the movie coming up, which is where Lizzie kills monster.
Oh my God, because they're like, you know, it's told in this movie jumps around a lot.
So it's Olivia Williams and Arnold investigating their house.
They're like, What's wrong?
What's going on here?
And you cut back to what happened, which is?
Lizzie accidentally cuts his throat and puts him in a refrigerator, turning that upside down.
By the way, How so?
Chill out.
No women and refrigerators.
That whole drop of like, um, yeah, well, it's It's like a thing that it's a mim on the Internet, about like how shitty movies are and how shitty, mostly comic books are.
Where and it's exactly.
This movie, which is like women are only used to make male characters feel more like like their death is like eyes only to service the male character's growth, which is exactly what happens to his wife.
But they flip it in this where she because in a comic book and wait a second.
So in comic books, a common death for women is to be tied up and murdered and thrown into a refrigerator.
No, it happened once, but it's kind of a it's a It's a symbol for what happens A lot in common with my girlfriend got killed.
Oh, my wife's gonna grieve.
And yeah, it don't make me go forward and be a cool dude, which is what this movie flips on its head.
And you know what?
Homo Indiana Jones four almost is that, Unfortunately, Healy somehow live.
I'm gonna get this refrigerator for feminism talky later.
I would love it if the movie's just like Indiana Jones is dead, and it is because of a nuclear refrigerator.
And then it's like cut to the marry in Ravenswood movie.
Yeah, where she just She's dealing with a man like, Get revenge for Indy.
That would be great.
That would never happen in 100,000,000 you know, But aliens could be sitting by the time in that movie he got into that fridge.
I was like, Oh, yeah, new kid.
Oh, my God.
Just light it here.
Yeah, so what?
I love again.
And it's just amazing moments of Olivia Williams Being terrible in this movie is they do the cross cutting between lengthy argument and them investigating the house, which I think also happens on another occasion in the damn.
Who cares?
Um, but Arnold opens the fridge, and it's like the elevator in the shining on Dhe.
She does a really good like like her holding back vomit is so hysterical.
I wish it was like eerie music and, like Slobo blood, like billing this dirty floor into a kid with a moppet haircut screaming.
But you can't hear the screen, eh?
Oh, yeah.
Listen, if you in your life, especially if it's just like a few days before hilariously slip and fall face first into a pool of human blood seeing blood fall out of a refrigerator.
Not going to induce vomiting.
Sorry.
If she doesn't do it in that instance of coming face to face with blood, seeing some of it fall out of the fridge is not going to do it.
No, but she's a homicide detective.
She must see death all of the time.
This is just Ah, quiet.
Sleepy town here in Atlanta.
Georgia.
Yeah, you're right.
So now we're the last act of the stupid fucking movie.
God.
And, you know, um, Lizzie calls Schwarzenegger's.
Okay, We have to meet for some reason.
Like a good idea.
The movie is getting a little law.
Just imagine what it would be like if it was.
Actually, three hours is within our 49 minutes, which is ridiculous.
And so he's like, a Why don't we meet in the parking garage?
And so Lizzie and sugar, like, damn, he's smart.
Oh, man, he's good.
G.
Oh, my God.
A parking structure which actually calls it.
Yes, please meet us in the car park, which tear it tear.
It has maybe five lines of dialogue in this movie, and I keep forgetting he's a character.
It's so ridiculous.
And again, maybe this is a victim of the three hour cut.
Maybe sugar had Ah, whole other ark.
We just never saw sugar going to the store up sugar, going to the bank, maybe go to the doctor.
Maybe there's a whole striptease routine in that scene that gets cut down like death proof.
Yeah, Terrence Howard dances for Kurt Russell.
I think Steve buddy Day dances for Lizzy.
But it would be great if stunt Man Mike was there, too.
Well, this is a little weird, but I'll take it.
He's just gonna kill you anyway.
You know, this would be a such a better movie if Stuntman Mike was in the background.
Eaten sloppy notches.
Sloppy strip club.
Not like it.
Every single shot, he's somewhere in the back.
It becomes like a two bit.
He cooks.
Thank you.
I'd love it.
Oh, and then a big shoot out Have a shoot out there like, will they criticize Arnold because they're like, Oh, he thinks he's so smart.
Ah, parking garages like a perfect place for an attack kind of thing.
We better kidnap somebody.
So there's like this like hostage situation for two seconds.
None of it comes to anything.
Then we have this huge car chase yes, through the streets of Atlanta, and it's a really bad car chase.
You barely see anything.
It's boring, like this is, This is like, This is your big ending action set piece.
Let's get to the finish line.
And it was I thought it was the most boring looking at the Dulles part of the movie because the majority of it is showing what Mariel he knows is doing.
And she's just riding in the open trunk of the sedan.
Yes, that they're driving.
So all you have to do is have these, like close Puncheon's on her.
You don't see anything.
I'm looking at the trunk of a car for most of this car chase, and she's do.
She's terribly over the top here.
She's like screaming and just spraying this machine gun at Arnold.
I think she's particularly terrible, but I do think this movie is 10 times better because she's in it.
And Melon Ackerman is not who actually dropped out of this role.
Yes, she would be worse that this somehow this movie could Gentlemen, this movie could be worth It could be three hours long.
Malin Akerman could be in a Terrance Howard might be doing instrument.
He didn't think it was possible.
My company's these numbers just don't add up.
This moving could have been worse, but they're right.
I have it all right in front of them.
Terrence Howard gets it.
This is my favorite part of this thing.
This'd, ah, urban cyclists like this hipster like gets hit by Terrence Howard And like, covers his whole windshield.
And like, there's blood everywhere because it is this movie.
His glasses are everywhere.
Pops like a balloon, this guy.
And, you know, Terrence Howard can't see and drives right into, Ah, a tow truck, I guess, or whatever.
It's like you have some sort of flatbed truck with, like, an empty bed, and it's my favorite kind of pale dude.
It is my favorite kind of movie death where someone is driving the car and they drive it into It's usually like a logging truck, you know where or like, a pole falls off the back of a freighter truck and goes right through the windshield.
This is like he did that duck like the Blues Brothers.
Do you know the whole top of this car is caught open like a sardine can get the top ripped off of it.
And Terrence Howard is just all over the street the next time baby destroyed.
It's so awesome.
And so then, like, you know, she's kind of shot in the back seat.
Arnold pulls up.
What are you doing?
Why did you do it?
Come on, let's get some.
Let's get some good exposition out here.
And the whole thing is, she says, like something one of you guys stole my mom, honey, and I just decided I'm going to kill all of you.
And he's like, I stole the money.
I took the money.
Lizzie.
Idiot!
Come on.
Copenhagen Thes People need air.
Uh, Dylan S O.
Arnold reveals he needed the $10,000,000 because he wants to go back to Mexico and use the money as a resource to help find the guy who killed his wife and son.
Who I have to stop watching the snuff film.
I need closure.
My wife said the refrigerator somewhere I need to find us.
And then, like Olivia Williams pulls up, and it's like before anyone knows what happens.
Arnold just murders Lizzie before she starts like talking too much or whatever.
And the most massage, the misogynistic stick coop to Gracie is this character that even following the whole time, is like Why?
What?
What happened?
Arnold, what are you doing?
And he just goes, Why don't you be a good little girl and be quiet and walks out of this movie?
And that's the last time we that's That's the end of the movie for Olivia Williams that happens to her and then the last we see of her cause.
Then Arnold slips away.
How could he slip away at Dude?
He puts a fucking invisibility cloak over himself, but he just likes It's literally Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor backing out of frame.
And then he's out of the movie.
Yeah, like movie Law dictates he's gone.
You great of, uh, some cop calls in like, Yeah, we got a read on that 80 year old Austrian guy that felt like a like a truck, but he's got long hair.
Let him go.
It's not him, not the same guy.
He doesn't have that hip rockabilly.
See, Alice haircut?
No.
Okay.
You know, this guy.
This guy's actually also built more like a brick shit house.
I don't know, maybe, but so then, like Harold Paranoia shows up, and he's like, What happened?
What happened in this movie?
And then she's like, Oh, we'll reach will tell you all about it And he turns around and he's like, reaching Where's Reacher?
Where's Reacher?
And she's like What?
He was right here.
And then the her line of this movie.
The threat of her character ends with her being berated.
Bye, Harold Para No, After being told to be a good little girl and shut up.
Yep.
Harold Paranoids like, what the fuck did you do?
What did you do?
Where's Reacher?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
And you're just like, Well, that's your being berated forever.
That's the end of your character.
Who I was such a jarring and terrible end of that character.
I kept expecting her to be in the end of this movie.
Like because what happened?
You know, 15 minute epilogue Do rice coffin slips away to go hunt these guys she should be hunting, you know that I thought was gonna be like at the end like he gets them.
But then she gets him, and it's like, Wow, So my next note is Mexico.
Why, dude, it's a bad boys to the movies over with.
Yes, the movie's totally over, and now we're just going to Mexico for no reason.
Just like a five minute rampage sequence with Arnold.
Good Rampage.
It's kind of just it's a rip off of the end of Unforgiven a bit, Yeah, he's wearing a cowboy hat.
That's probably as faras the rip of goes, so that's not true.
But Arnold, in this cowboy hat, let me tell you something.
Here's the thing about cowboy hats.
If you're gonna wear a cowboy hat, you need to have a cowboy hat that fits your head.
It fits your body, right?
So, in the case of Arnold Schwarzenegger, wearing a normal person sized cowboy hat is one of the funniest things you'll ever.
You have to go to a Mexican restaurant where they have a big cowboy hat on a bear and then take that like you don't really want.
You should've been in a sombrero.
He needs a sombrero.
A regular old cowboy hat is not gonna cut it.
It looks like he's wearing, like Woody's hat from Toy Story on his huge body.
You didn't take a proper Send your moose or something, Get it off of a cartoon character and put it on your watermelon head.
So water Valent had kicks in the door of the bows.
Eisley Cantina here it just shoots it up.
Well, he follows one guy into the bathroom.
Who is the guy that was torturing its wife?
Because, I guess, like, he basically just throws all this money that this Mexican official, like, done their star.
It's styles and he's just putting like Okay, okay, just stacks of money on this dude's desk and he's like, but that's all I have.
You're either going to give me the information, going to take all this money back with me.
So that's where the $10,000,000 comes in handy.
And he he basically follows this guy to the bathroom who's about to have sex with this woman.
Obviously, the way we get more nudity here or no, no, no, we don't allow it.
Surprising.
It's very surprising.
Oh, boo.
Hey, hey.
I didn't get those cheese farts for nothing.
He was.
So he he throws her down like a sack of garbage and beat this guy up for five seconds and then put the gun in his head is like and the guys like you know what, man?
In perfect English, even those guys.
A cartel member.
He's like, I'm the last man that ever had your wife and you're always gonna know that, which is kind of a sick burn in the situation's kind of truth, Like it is one of those.
It's one of those characters.
It's kind of like, um, what's his face in the departed Ray?
Whatever his name is, Winston Ray Winston.
It's that same kind of character where it's like you have such a disregard or ambivalence for your own life.
Like this guy is not begging for his life.
No, he's face first in an ice filled urinal about to be murdered by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
And he's like, You know what, man?
I fucked your wife deal with that when I go to the grave, and he's like when I lit it, and I love how he takes the high road here.
Yeah, he certainly takes the high Wow, she's like, Well, I could have made it would be such a good drivers on the urinal eyes.
That's a way more appropriate.
Chill out, sister.
You should've peed on him after.
Well, I could I could have killed your family.
But I'm not like you.
I'm a real hero.
I just killed 41 people that were my best friends for the reason.
And then that song from Dr A Real Heroes real human being andare the euro sea.
They did not license the karaoke.
Right?
So I get it.
I get using real year old in my movie.
Take that, Ryan Gosling.
I told you I would have a dominance over that song.
And I used this hack up better than you.
Look at me.
I would love the end credits to be her as a meter maid walking around two shattered at that Arnold Schwarzenegger karaoke of a really a hero from Dr Yeah.
You look so tough in your big gold scorpion jacket.
Well, I'm going to carry out, give the shit out of the song now, so it's like he murders this dude and then, you know, he knows he's dead at this point.
Then we have the cantina crowd equivalent.
Hey, what the far warmer, and it's a huge shootout.
He's now All bets are off.
He's gonna give it.
Is the Unforgiven, too?
Yeah, he's killing men, women and children.
In doing so many women in this, they are drawing on him, So he is defense yourself.
Think it's American right to this foreign land?
It's justified.
That's another show with someone with cowboy hats.
And he just he kills everybody in the canteen.
Afford the most part.
There's a couple of ladies left like weeping over their friends, and he sits back down and like, Oh my God, this has Dude and he just takes a pull on that big Ding Dongs cigar on.
These is a That's the movie, you know he's dead.
Oh, yeah, he did.
He's, you know, I've been here.
I better have this.
Jack Daniels at the Smoke a cigar and the reader Maxim magazine saying it's while listening to Metallica's later stuff because that was a real band.
Is this one's for you?
Months.
The It's I disappear.
Wow, Wow, the career.
Okay, right.
Oh man.
And then we just cut the credits, and it's like one of the shittiest movies.
I'm so thankful that this movie got switched in like I originally wanted to do this lame Rufus Sewell Herry Joel Haley Joel as Mitt Time travel movie, Which is bad.
I think it's called I'll Follow you down.
Go check it out if you can.
But this movie, man I mean, here's the thing.
That's the movie it's over with.
I would recommend this movie for one reason.
Okay, watch this movie, and any other time you dare make fun of Arnold Schwarzenegger for anything else.
Think about how bad this movie is and think about how great we've had it for literally.
This is, I think, the nay dear It's dude.
It's the worst Arnold Schwarzenegger movie I've ever seen in my life.
Well, it's completely joyless, which is a big problem for a normal Schwarzenegger.
Maybe it's for starters.
Yeah, like the nobody's having fun.
Everyone's just mean to each other and shitty, and everyone's just cursing for no reason.
I I would I would recommend it.
Also, I kind of have to by default, even though it's 25 minutes too long.
But I had such a laugh at this movie more so, Yeah, any other movie we've done in the best 2014.
It's not the worst movie of best 2014 but I laughed at it hardest.
It's it's a laugh riot.
You know, I was not gonna recommend it, but Andrew, you convinced me with that argument.
I do think people should check it out just because now you have an accurate barometer, you know?
Yeah, well, I mean, thing about it is everyone in this movie has been associated with something far better.
Oh, yeah, Maybe not Sam worthy.
But everybody.
I mean, no, like Avatar, that Terminator move.
Those movies are better than this movie.
Like everyone, everyone has done better.
You know what I mean?
Even that scrawny d a investigator was on Angel and another job Sweden project.
Or to do you think that Merrill, you know, says he's gonna kill her career because I feel like she might suffer the worst one.
I would say you might be onto something if anyone saw this.
That that's what I was just about that guy for that you have to see movies, too.
Damn people for being in them.
And nobody saw this movie.
I mean, I don't know when it was exactly released I believe it was, like early enough on and 24.
Totally was 2014.
I mean, it was 2014 for sure.
Um, but she's bouncing back from this.
I mean, she's she's a great idea to Yeah, I think that.
But she just got in the wrong movie and, like, she committed too hard.
Like, Like, do the Olivia Williams thing and kind of back out of it.
You know what I mean?
If you could find yourself, it's habit.
Uh, please don't like double ass a movie.
You need to be half.
Fasten your performance in exact Olivia Williams knows exactly how much of her ass to use in this room.
And the fact that she doesn't go over the top.
You're just like all right, well, that's just really terrible, but you don't care.
So it's fine like it makes you.
Terrence Howard is totally half as in this movie.
Terrence Howard.
Half ass is most things that he's in.
But like merrily knows the fact that you're like going so far the other way.
Yeah, it makes people think you were excited to be in this movie, which you clearly couldn't have been.
I mean, I would be excited to be cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger movie cause I'm like nobody and I would love to be in a movie with Arnold.
But even still, I'd be like, Well, this is terrible.
You know, this is clearly terrible Arnold Schwarzenegger grabbing my head and doing like a Rikio thing where they smashed my brains and that's on my bucket.
I mean, almost everything.
I do that to all of us.
If he ever listen to this spot and you know what?
I would welcome it because it would be a great way to die be an honorable way to die and would be a fitting end for my run on the show.
He's gonna crush all three of our heads and then sit down in a bar, drink whiskey and smoke a cigar.
But I've killed three do York fat liberals with 48% body fat each.
This is a good day.
Let me say this, though.
One thing I didn't mention.
We're talking about the very end of this.
This movie does indeed leave the door open for a sequel.
Doesn't because you don't see a booking dot dude his eyes or oh, you know you're looking for sequels?
No, but I'm telling you all you have.
If you want to make sabotage to all you have to do, you cut back to that cantina and he's like, Oh oh, and he slumps over the table.
Boom in burst the d E a.
We run in there.
They grab him, Put him on a stretcher, dude.
Sabotage to, I think, because the one thing I was going to give this movie aside from Winter's tale, it's the only bad movie we watched in this little compendium that we have for 2014.
That is it begging for a sequel.
It's not begging for it.
It's not begging for a sequel.
It's not a you're not gonna believe this, But if you get some like Middle Eastern royalty to finance a shitty movie you wanna make, you could easily take that script.
Change 4 to 6 things about it.
We make it sabotage to wait a second.
If you do know someone like that with deep pockets, get this up and running so that Arnold could crush your head.
Sabotage, too.
There will be an Internet campaign going for us to have cameos in the movie where our old squashes airhead like watermelon.
I think it should be called sabotages sabotages.
Oh, multiple sabotage, which is makes it a better movie.
Yeah, because they were that will be sabotaging him all over the place.
That's sabotage from the previous year.

Sure, So what stuff?
We throw another that people should check out if they have Not yet.
Ah, movie.
That's way better than sabotage.
That's a great action.
Movie is the guest.
I mean, it's more of an action horror, but like it's lean, it's mean and it just gets in and out is really smart.
And it's a awesome movie.
It's totally like, What's the dudes who made your next?
So which is 2030?
Yeah, that I think we actually recommend you go running back, man.
It's a total like John Carpenter Love Letter like that movie is like a carpet.
It's really great.
The soundtrack is amazing and ah, inherent Vice is one of my favorite of the year.
I really, really enjoyed in their advice.
Um, it's not PT Andersons best movie, but, I mean, he can still make, like, okay movies.
And they're like, sticking with me now that I think that this is just an okay movie, Okay?
I also think Brolin should have got best supporting over Duval like, Oh, he's awesome.
That's his best performance.
Like easily.
I think he's really good.
I think Joaquin's fantastic in the Yes, yes, that's a totally overlooked performance.
Also.
Boyhood Boyhood.
You've heard of it.
If you if you haven't seen boyhood, I can't recommend that enough, Um, another one that I would recommend.
It's a film called The One I Love.
It's directed by Malcolm McDowell's son, Charlie McDowell.
It's Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss.
I think it's streaming on Netflix.
It's like a weird yes, it is like, That's how I saw it.
It's like it's like a in the ish romantic thing with, like, such a bizarre twist to it that they, thankfully, did not give anything away for like in the ads or whatever.
But it's a totally enjoyable movie.
Also good.
Ted Danson cameo Also the Baby Duke, which, when you watch it, which is a totally great movie.
But you will be saying, Baby, do Crow Long time.
It's a fantastic movie.
It's really scary, but also, like again.
And I actually think that she's amazing in that movie and kind of was overlooked.
I mean, that awards really matter in Everwood, an Australian our movie be nominated for an Oscar, but she is fantastic.
Speaking of not name nominated for Oscars, and also some of our audience might disagree with me, but Snowpiercer, I thought was one of the better movies of the year.
Dude, Bon Joon ho does not make bad movies, and this year was no exception with Snowpiercer.
It's a really great movie, great Tilda Swinton, but I think it's on Netflix as well is and its balls to the wall.
And it actually proves to me that, like Chris, Chris Evans has got, like a good career ahead of him, of just being like he does that square jaw action thing, but actually bringing something to the table as opposed to just like blankly looking at you, you know?
I mean, like, he's got a charisma and a personality.
That boy's gonna be a star.
Yes, someday, if only he could break out the big franchise s.
Oh, those are just some of the things we saw from last year that you should definitely check out of you having it.
And also, I will say this going into the next month.
We have the Academy Awards coming up February 22nd S O.
The next month is kind of skewed around the Academy Awards a little bit.
Steve, do you want to explain what we're doing?
Yeah, Every year we kind of make up a new theme month where we have, like, a wild card month.
We're pushing into February.
This time it's basically we're taking one category, each category, each major acting category and taking a terrible movie from one of the nominees and doing it s o taking the piss out of people.
Exactly.
So the clues for the entire month of February are just going to be those people.
Sure.
So we're starting with best supporting actor.
So the clue for next week is Ethan Hawke.
He's nominated for boyhood.
Do we think he will win for boyhood?
This is something we will do some Oscar, right?
Predicting here.
I walking over here.
I was thinking that.
But then Steve reminded me about a K.
Simmons and Whiplash, which I just recently saw, which is also good.
Not the greatest, but good.
And it's really his movie E.
I think now I'm thinking J.
K.
Simmons is gonna win.
I think it's probably a toss up between the two of them.
I don't see anyone else in that supporting it.
Dude, that's a Oh, you're 80.
What?
Yeah, that's a charitable.
Let's haven't given you one in a while.
We'll send you off to the sun.
God run honor.

So we'll see what happens on February 22nd for then next week's episode.
Ethan Hawke do with that what you will until next week.
