Mohr making fun of things made by people with way more money than us.
Hello, Amanda, Jew Pin, Eric Cisco, Steven say today and we hate movies.
No wait movies.
Thank you for tuning in.
As always, if you're new to the program this week, we're doing what we like to call a movie that technically shouldn't be really like.
This is this is like almost a fake movie.
It's nineteen nineties Abraxas, guardian of the universe, starring our good friend the Govern ater or he wasn't a NATO was just the body the body governor on I was the NATO Jesse the Body Ventura.
Just call me Ralph Nader.
I'LL punch your throat out.
You know that guy made made seatbelts a law.
I want to punch that guy right in the throat, making me wear a seat belt.
That's not America.
That's how they track you.
They put tracking mechanisms and your seat belt That could be a thing that could very well could be a thing.
So it's Jesse the Body Ventura and our good friend Sven Aly Thorsen, who's been in so many things.
He's he's best buds with the Govern ater our Schwarzenegger days.
Yeah, he's gotten around all these big, big the rounds of the governor's really Governors Ball.
That guy's having this movie is directed by a fellow, by the way named Damien Lee, who also stars in the movie a little bit and produced it.
Real Passion Project.
If this guy on DH, it is a complete Terminator rip off, it's It's such a Terminator rip up and it's not even funny.
How much is a Terminator?
Rude and I hate terminated rip offs because Terminator is got a really specific action movie engine that I you know I'm cooking.
I'm wrong.
It invented you know what I mean?
Like, protect the kid.
Let's go through the thing.
I'm from another world.
I mean, if it didn't invent it, it's the one that made it the most famous.
So with that, to take that any other way other than Terminator, it's just really like Oh, you did that, huh?
Yeah.
You know, two guys from the future coming into the past, they're unkillable fighting machine.
Well, what if they are space cops?
Okay, coming in instead of from the from from the future from outer space.
Okay.
All right.
I like that.
I like that idea.
Let's let's call them finders.
Because you know what?
They're good at finding things.
Men.
They do not terminate the fine.
Yes, the un creative names for things in this movie.
Like, you know, we always joke about, you know, don't make a big, super complicated name for something, you know, like a brexit.
Just make if you're gonna have a ray gun like called a gun.
You know what I mean?
It doesn't need to be a trans Ma Griff eyeing light death Ray or whatever.
Not that that movie does that, but like a finder stop.
That's just not even a thing.
Well, and the problem with this movie is the audio mix.
Or at least in the only way we could have seen this movie.
One of the shittiest VHS tapes known to man.
But what are you going to dio?
That was a DVD.
That was a DVD that I bought.
Dude, that is definitely a VHS transfer, though I'm DVD, but the audio mix.
I actually printed it out because I was able to find out how they mixed the audio.
The dialogue they turned out to twelve point four percent.
The saxophone.
They pumped up to two hundred places because just its people and try to talk over the sacks.
Suppose score.
And it's like talking in a subway tunnel.
It's like, What?
What?
What?
You gotta know when to use your saxophone to you.
You know what?
Chase scenes.
Not so much a good idea?
No, because then you're in like a John Grisham thriller.
That's when If you're if you're in a chase scene in a John Grisham thriller, that's where the saxophone comes in.
Pickup back, basketball game.
Now let's let's get that sexy going, huh?
Picking up a lady taking her to the bedroom?
Yes, most definitely.
That's what's with the sex phone.
Usually, that's when the saxophone becomes sex.
A phone.
That's why Bill Clinton learned how to play it.
That was the only reason that's the way I'm going to get all these chicks in Arkansas.
Just learn how to play the sexy phone.
Oh yeah, Should I say sex?
A phone.
I'm at saxophone.
Copyright Bill Clinton, nineteen sixties have on Al Gore may have invented the Internet, but I've read the sex.
A phone man in Hollywood ripped it off.
Ah, yes.
So it's a Terminator.
Ryba for, Ah, Praxis is a finder.
He's ten thousand years.
No, let's.
Let's get the exact age.
Oh, God.
The exact date.
Because I have it.
Deal.
Okay, you do the ten thousand years on the job as a finder.
I've been finding things for ten thousand years now.
Now that I was, I was I was flaunting that I had the exactly eleven thousand one hundred eleven thousand eight hundred sixty years old.
So my first one thousand eight hundred sixty two years on the planet I was in high school.
I was running finders.
Track team meets.
What?
What does this guy get to retire?
What kind of watch do you get at ten thousand years of service?
Is it made out of starlight?
Like what?
What's also interesting is like.
His hair is graying at this point.
He's bald, bald is anything, and it's like That's what you look like when you're nearing twelve thousand years old.
What does a decrepit person from Abraxas is?
Home planet?
Look like, you know, one hundred thousand years old, like that's like some Yoda ship.
But even Yoda was only like, what, Like eight hundred years old room?
Yeah, that's about good ballpark.
Think true, Bacchus three hundred and your get your back was up there.
You know, it's pretty ridiculous.
Yeah, he's just got all these old fuckers defending the galaxy.
Well, ours did meet Alec A.
This is a young pup in that movie.
They still treat me so poorly because I'm the young and of the group.
But the speed of the ball thing like this is I was really surprised.
If you thinking if you're about to say what I'm thinking, you're about to say I was shocked that just the vitamin tourist not wearing a bandanna in this movie I know I was going to say that we'Ll get out of the way right now.
But the secret rat, Yes, that's what I thought you were going.
But you're totally right, Steve, when you put a bandanna on this guy because here's the thing that doesn't happen, right?
There's always like in Terminator, right?
He goes through the time tunnel and he's nude and he goes and he gets the bikers clothing, you know, he's blending in But Abraxas is doing a really bad job at blending in.
He's wearing a world's Jim T shirt the entire film.
Ah, brown trench coat.
Oh, yeah, Nothing screams sex criminal.
Hey, looks like a forty second Street flash Aaron.
He looks disgusting.
And then you got that secret rat tail where you don't even see it till, like, thirty minutes into the movie.
He just turns at the right angle and the little tail just flops out.
And I was like, That just makes so much sense.
It's like being a Jed iPad.
Owen, I got this rat tail after by ten thousand.
Year of service is because I'm only eleven thousand years old.
I'm might as well basically be a teenybopper.
So I got my pad a one rat tail.
So Ah, Damon and I know you have a really strong views on the costuming, but do you think maybe a praxis and the rest of the finders could have bandannas or backwards baseball caps?
What the fuck do you think this is aside from my vision?
Of course not.
You will be bald with a rat on a world's Jim T shirt, a rat tail when you're bald.
He kind of looks like Samuel Coleridge.
It's not like it's just an old school, an old timey old friends kind of thing.
I was wearing a powdered wig.
Yeah, I mean, he looks really bad and he's also very out of shape.
Yeah, at this point, he's got a thin face like his face hadn't really started to age yet.
And those those those gorgeous brown eyes we're still listening, but everything about everything else is just run down and tired and wearing a gold's gym t show.
Now, I don't remember the exact dates here, but but Running Man was not that long ago, right?
Like it was.
It was in running.
Man, I want to say is like eighty six.
There's something this is seven or something like that.
And this is what this was filmed in December of eighty nine.
What the fuck happens?
The hard times happened.
Oh, shit.
I can't can't come to the Christmas party.
I'Ll be filled.
Viggo Praxis that day.
Yes, Sorry, The director Damien Lee's making me work on Christmas.
He's a real slave driver.
This movie's nineteen ninety and running man's eighty seven.
Yeah, that's actually kind of ridiculous that he's there is some real, like ex wrestler living in a car situation.
Well, that's the thing is, I think that stare once.
Once you get off the steroids and you're not working out all right, that turns to fat, Immediate, like choosing the wrong Grail it.
But you've got to stay on steroids or fund, you know, maybe do some diamond Dallas page yoga.
I chose poorly.
I chose the Bejeweled Cup and it really blew up in my face.
I didn't know I gotta play.
Abraxas is like, How is this a movie that somebody like there?
I mean, there's not a lot of money in this movie, clearly like the saxophone budget was out of control.
But, like, how did you like what?
What is the point of this movie?
Did do you think this was going to get released in theaters?
Was this all people won't notice?
We filmed this mostly and somebody's backyard.
It was on ah farm in Ontario.
You know, I did a Google image search of this movie.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
And I found a VHS cover that was grossly inaccurate in the film because it had a ah younger Jesse on there with the mustache.
What That's like.
Listen, if you're putting the moustache on the VHS case, better find a fucking mustache in that movie.
Yeah, definitely.
What?
I mean, what was the opposition having like we know, he congratulatory eight mustache.
All crap.
I trimmed it too short.
Now I look ridiculous.
We're gonna have to go reshoot the whole film because I'm going to shave it off before I get to set.
Maybe got so into the character that he was a brash Abraxas wouldn't have almost.
But if anything of brexit would definitely have a mustache because all of praxis is is a space cop low.
Yeah, right.
Look, if I can't have the if I can't have my bandanna, I've gotta shave my mustache.
I look like I just ate mean Gene okerlund.
It's a bad look for me.
Him was a bandanna and a mustache.
That's just Hulk Hogan.
Yeah, that's true.
He will, you know, reminded trying to steal a little bit of the Hulkster Sunder.
I mean, so yeah, he's a space cop And the beginning of the movie he's taking you through.
I guess every ten years they every ten million years.
Who gives a fuck They get, like, reconfigured or re you, like, re sign your contract to continue being a finder?
Yeah, on DH.
And you get your finder's fee.
Oh, you'LL get a finder's fee.
All right, you're going to pay through the nose, But yeah, the whole thing is he's kind of becoming, like, reminded me of like those scenes in all the X Men movies where Wolverine has flashbacks of getting the Adam and Skeleton because they're basically like drilling all these computer things into him.
And he's explaining what's going on with all this stuff.
And what is obnoxious about this movie is you sit there and listen to him be like So then another thing that got implanted into my body and he's going through it all.
And then it cuts to these two guys that are in this, like, alien control room.
And they're kind of like the managers of all the finders, you know?
Yeah, they'd lay, like, run the outpost.
Where?
In like, the Far, Far Quadrant where Earth is located.
Yet no one knows about you mean the upright citizens brigade?
Yeah, that's what they look like exactly like that.
But then those guys tell you literally the exact same thing that Jesse the body Ventura just told us, which is like And then you may have noticed that a brexit was getting an operation in that operation.
I was like, What?
No, he just told us every you see, Abraxas has a computer body.
If you haven't put it together yet, is his abdomen is nothing but clunky computer monitors tied together.
And they they specify also because this will be very important at the end of the film that a finder is not allowed to have any kind of relationship outside of the job.
You're married to the beat.
You're married to the space Beat you ten thousand years of the space beat of man.
I'm sick and tired of space jerking off.
Oh my men.
Second issues to share an apartment, wait, hang out, watch, have a couple of beers, watch the game and then we'd retire to our own domiciles.
We do what was up.
So is the cunt is, by the way, is mentally thoreson, and it's it's a really you know, it's a really sad sorry Abraxas and some condoms were once partners in space crime.
We're fighting space fighting.
You found it but then sell condoms became very disillusioned and I guess, became a bad guy or something.
Not for nothing.
It's kind of glossed over.
Well, he became obsessed with power.
Oh, of course, obtaining the anti life equation.
Now can we get into this for a second?
Because there's someone in this room who knows what that is, and it's not me.
And probably not Aaron.
No, no, definitely not somebody's getting all in a tizzy about the anti life equation.
So we're gonna have to go to resident comic book expert Steve saying back to explain to us why this is pretty much copyright infringement.
No, it's absolutely Jack Kirby for all my fellow nerd friends created the He's the Batman fellow.
No jet.
Jack Kirby was the Batman guy.
That's a Bob Kane, Bob, because I was gonna say finger by finger is not the guy that got the credit Bill.
Finger and Bob came created Batman.
I fingered the wrong moons, But sorry, Jack Kirby did a bunch of mostly known for his marvel working created the X Man.
He created the hall, etcetera, etcetera.
But he also for D.
C.
Created this thing like called the New Gods, which is a pantheon of new gods, etcetera, etcetera.
Now, what year we talking with this?
This is like the seventies, maybe even early eighties, and it was really popular, but kind of died off eventually.
But you know what?
The concept of bad guy, the macguffin of the whole thing was this thing of dark side was looking for the anti life equation and oh, my God, here it comes.
Get in the anti life equation and this movie is that you never heard of that right on.
Also, they have things called mother boxes, which are, like, kind of basically proto cellphones.
Proto iPhones.
I should say that this movie rips off his well, they called him Answer boxes like, How are you getting away with this shit?
Like, Maybe that's why this movie was never actually released theatrically.
They were like, you ripped us off so bad you have to be directive idiot.
Just less you incur the wrath of DC Illegals department.
Although, I mean, I'm not sure No, Kirby, Was he one of the comic book guys that Wisconsin li like ripped on Oh, famously.
So baby was like, Well, we can't We shouldn't stand up for that then because now it will look bad for us because we're ripping him off Teo, everybody.
Yeah, I don't know exactly.
That's that's kind of the thing is like, it's a and I think DC at this point didn't give a shit because there's never been or will be a film of the new gods.
Yeah, so I think that they're like, Fuck it.
You mean they're not going to try to wedge the new gods into this Batman Superman movie?
Because the rest of the games there, they should rest of this fucking big old pot of soup they're making with this movie?
Honestly, I think I mean, you might see tomorrow in the trades.
Abraxas is probably going to make it into this movie.
Thank God I was able to be in the reprise my role as a praxis in Batman vs Superman.
Oh, that green lantern movie tanked so bad that they the only space cup they could get was a brexit.
They really fucked that franchise right up green landers and movie jail.
Really?
Abraxas is getting out pulling the old switcheroo on the green lantern.
Ever thought I'd see the light of day?
Is his rat tails now?
Like Dad Whose ass?
God wait.
But so what?
What does this anti life equation mean in the comics?
Do you ever really find out?
Try to find out.
It's just like a way of like him, Like enslaving the world kind of a thing like it's all about like, anti life would be slavery.
Which means Wait, Is that the comic book?
Yes.
Okay, because that's also exactly with that well, this movie.
But this movie, it sounds like he'LL enter another dimension.
Yeah, like there's a little bit of that.
I could still be like God of the next dimension.
But the but the thing that the Upright Citizens Brigade is so worried about eyes that once he enters the other dimension with the anti life equation, several worlds will just explode or something like like they will be like a like, this dimensional rift that'll potentially harm the the fabric of the universe.
So all this we are telling you because this movie takes a really takes a ninety minutes to tell you that and tells you that in another room while a record is playing in the room.
You're currently and you're like, Wait, what head?
So Abraxas goes to Toronto to fucking find second ist.
They find each other immediately, and they have a laser fighting in the dark.
That's like the one thing that this movie has is a little bit of a pyrotechnics budget behind it.
But it's kind of just like we're going to bundle a bunch of Chinese fireworks and see what happens.
Kind of pyrotechnics.
It's not actual like there's a couple of actual explosions in this movie, but for the most part it's Chinatown.
Fireworks.
Yeah, that and laser tag.
So the whole thing, that's what My favorite scene in the movie.
So they both get to earth, and it's again.
It's very Terminator like, Oh, where am I?
Whatever I'll go find the person I'm assigned to find all while keeping in communication on their little speaker box thing.
What does it answer?
Bo Answer box.
Pardon me with it with the Upright Citizens Brigade is telling Abraxas like where he confined psychologists and everything, So he's trying to get the four one one on psychologists, and they're chasing each other in the Ontario woods.
And then we cut to this car, pulls off, and it's a little bit of a lover's lane.
Situation on DH This lady, the actress in the film, the lead actress Jim Belushi's ex wife, by the way, put that your back pocket because that's going to come into play.
A little later, Jim Belushi's ex wife rolls up with some dude, and he's trying to put the moves on her in the car, and she's not having it and then succumbed.
ISS decides to play the role of the Zodiac killer on He fucking breaks the window of this car and pulls this dude out and murders him.
And then this girl's running through the woods.
We got a little bit of a chase scene here and then in a really odd turn for this move because it's the one part that isn't explained through exposition before it happens, is second, isjust puts his hand up to this chick's belly, and a blue light comes up and you're hearing this computer talking and it's like, OK, computer insemination complete.
She will give birth in five minutes and, like Wait, what the fuck are you even talking about Oh, man, What a scene!
Like I didn't know this was about the hat.
And the answer box on Jesse Ventura's going off is talking about how he warning he's with a birthing member of the species.
So that's the thing is fucking second.
ISS is coming down to earth looking to get that shit wet, you know, looking to get that shit wet, his palm wet.
Yes, yes, exactly.
Because he doesn't.
All I have to do is put my hand up to her belly and then I will get her space pregnant.
That's what we used to do in space when we retire to our chambers, which is really unfortunate because, I mean, she doesn't really feel anything.
But Second IST doesn't really appear to feel anything, either.
He's like, Okay, this complete.
Now I mean it.
Space rape.
Let's let's let's put that right.
Oh, it's space rain, for sure, but no one orgasms either side.
No one enjoyed it, but like it's just it's really weird because she's just like Okay, well, that's the thing.
She doesn't even really know what's going on and then, is she?
It's one of those weird science fiction's things, and this happens in a couple of different side five things like the rapid pregnancy thing.
And she's just like, Wait all of a sudden, like or what's happening But because this is so low budget, you don't see anything.
It's just her walking around with a stomachache on.
Then, like Ventura comes up and he's just like our crap.
Sikander is got tour.
This's going to be bad.
Another second is junior Man, that's a condoms has so many kids.
It's like old dirty bastard for exposition sake.
Now, now, the reason why second is one's children is so that he could birth one.
That could be the homemade.
Er, say again, please.
The cold mater home made.
Er this is looking for psycho Mehta.
You hear that word ninety times And you also hear you, Sarah Khanna, second iss and Abraxas, both of their names used at least three hundred times that I think that that's like ninety percent of the script.
Hello, Abraxas.
Alosha!
Candice, have you seen?
Have you seen the comet?
No, I have not yet found the co maid.
Or have you seen it?
She can dish No, but excess.
I have not because they're both aliens, by the way.
Like you know, Jesse Ventura can't really have any snappy one liners because there's to be stiff and rigid.
So we can't be like, Hey, asshole, get over here.
He's acting like a goddamn robot and its hair.
But it's like it's like, you ever want to see Jesse Ventura Place E three p.
M.
But then we have a movie for you.
But But you know, by the way, what happens is second Iskan vent put his answer box up to the co mater, which would be half second is half human, right?
And then the answer box will scan his head.
And then it will assess if he possesses the anti life equation.
I don't know if that that means the co maitre knows it, or it's like something this answer box can isolate and ignite or whatever.
But it's a big deal.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Boy, am I glad that I don't have the equation and me because I just can't do math now.
The I was never good with equation is solve for X shotgun.
This you're not getting off this planet.
I don't know you nothing with the rapid pregnancy.
Why it's so stupid in this movie.
So she's like, Oh, what the fuck happened to obey?
And like has a baby immediately and the president segregated like Alright, Alright, Abraxas, you've got to kill this lady or else the co mater is going to be born.
A million people are going to die and it's a really bad see?
Well, it's already born like he gets there too late and it's about to happen in all the rush.
It's what I do.
You're terminated really bad around babies.
You see these telling a man like blast that fucking kid, blast that woman, blast him all that I just don't know if I can pull the trigger.
I feel like if I pulled the trigger, we might not have a movie.
This's like See you later.
Abraxas see wins the second bag because you're not going to do shit to that baby.
But then it's just a weird thing where they're like it's like Juno.
It is like the film Juno and a lot of ways.
Shockingly, this movie is void of any hilarious cheeseburger phones, but I guess we'LL have to live with it.
That fucking movie.
But that's the thing is so he the birth happens immediately and Abraxas like All right, I'll see you in five years, talk to you later and leave.
Yes, the country's goes off to where he goes, Tio.
And then we just have this weird domestic drama for a little bit.
Where she goes toe like registered the baby.
Yeah, like City Hall or something like that.
And this guy's like, Wait, So how did you get this baby?
What?
Where's the father?
And she's like, I'm the mother, and he's like, on Who's the father?
I'm the mother, not you.
Ever see Predator?
He's the guy who played the Russian general for a second.
What else?
Oh wow, you're married to spend only Doris's.
You know, he's just the father, so she like, registers the baby and his name's Tommy or some shit.
Thomas.
Oh, pardon me.
WeII.
We flash forward five years, and now she's narrating the movie.
There's a there's a lot of slippery slopes with with the many narrators we have in this film.
The voiceover.
It's a baton man.
There's a fun running around.
This is running the show for a while, just Conda says all way to log narration of this movie.
It is.
I'm sick, Understand?
I need to find the gold made.
Especially because finally, Thorson's command of English is way worse than aural shorts.
Oh yeah, barely.
You barely understand a word, he says.
So she's just like so I have decided to raise Tommy on my own, and I love him and he's great.
And it's five years later, By the way, you're like, uh and and he just you know, he's a great kid.
Doesn't talk, though.
He's five years old and he's mute.
Well, let's start the movie again and they're like playing in the snow.
It's clearly just the same field we just had the big Abraxas Sikander shoot out in.
It's the same farm in Ontario we're filming, and then we cut back to the UCB.
They haul Abraxas into their office, and they're like, Listen, a Praxis, this is the deal, So condoms broke out of jail again.
Music Fuck.
Come on.
Seriously.
Like I just put that guy away five years ago, which in Abraxas time is like two minutes, because I've eighty thousand also to let you guys know the upright citizens Brigade does not.
And under no.
Under no circumstances are they allowed to execute a finder or a former finder.
Right capital punishment.
Totally cool.
But just not for cops ever.
Well, it's like those those bullshit diplomat license plates you see around here, you know, especially like around the U N, like they can not get parking tickets.
And you can, like, run people over while drunk driving.
And you don't get in trouble like it's the worst system ever.
That's what key their cars.
Man, you have reviewing going.
You have to teach them a lesson.
Somehow I don't have to control.
I just thought of a drop.
All in this movie would make this movie a lot more, you know, follow a ble.
He's gonna know the fuck the word co mater is or Komada Orca meter.
Why not just call that kid the keeper?
Because then it's just the finders finding the open because then here's why.
They were too tempted that then Jesse Ventura would have a line Finders Keepers, which is great for the trailer, but because he's a row.
But he can't have clever action lines.
What would be great to is if someone could get the jump on Jesse Ventura and he'LL be a trapper.
Oh yeah, that's the trappers.
Now get the'keeper's Hey Trapper Keeper like like Lisa Frank making trapper keepers cut This breaks at a space ark of or whatever.
Don't worry, we don't see any of that.
I didn't even know he broke out of jail.
I was like, Why did they wait five years to pick this movie backup?
Apparently he was incarcerated, and I just missed that entire thing.
Oh, and by the way, you see be Space station is like three feet by three feet.
You know, it's like you thought the satellite of love set with shitty look at this fucking thing.
It's a it's a refrigerator there, acting again.
It's like the cockpit from Plan nine from outer space.
It's a curtain and two wooden chairs.
Pretty budge, and one's got one Guy is pro Abraxas.
The other guy's not pro.
Brax is because Abraxas let this kid didn't abort this kid because Praxis is pro life.
Yeah, once.
Hey, listen, Once the country's put his hand on that woman stomach, that was a life.
Yeah, life begins a touch like forget that life begins at weird, blue lighted Palm Thing should base rape I don't care for she was space raped.
I mean, lot of lot of good things have come at a bad situations, is all I'm saying.
I don't care that her ins the condoms were brother and sister, not even exactly based God.
Fighting's away.
I don't care how paid for and how life threatening giving birth at Big Pregnant three Win itches.
I will not terminate this pregnancy.
You could grow up to be a fine day one day.
Give me ten thousand years.
So he's sent back to Earth to chase after him because they know such kindness is coming for.
The idea is like now who's going to find John Connor first?
So horrendous or brag?
So the fact that they didn't execute Sikander means now psychologist can easily get to Earth, find this kid, but the answer box up to his head and potentially destroy this universe is basically more or less.
That's in a nutshell.
What we're dealing, we're here.
Yeah, that's that's a good summary.
Funny thing is so like they make this thing because it's one of the best.
Like workaround toe having absolutely no money in your movie.
They're like, all right, er, Praxis, You know, second isjust just a hijack dislike weapons cargo hold.
So we're going to get and he's got the best weapons in the world.
We're going to give you the best weapons in the world.
What?
You're not going to see that you're going to go into this wormhole?
And they put him in this wormhole in the oh, shit.
They cross the streams now none of them have any weapon.
Now, none of them have any weapons.
But somehow you held on to that world's Jim T shirt also, because we get a little bit of Abraxas narration right here, the first of all when he's explained.
So then So then Sikander is broke out of jail.
And the thing you need to remember audience about Sikander is is that he's an uncontrollable malcontent, which is what he calls him, which is awesome.
And then they're explaining the transportation system, and this is what makes no sense because he's an alien and he doesn't know anything about Earth.
But he goes, Yeah, it's kind of like an intergalactic subway system.
Where the fuck did you get that from?
I mean, it's true.
But where did you get that from?
You can't call someone about head, But you know what?
A subway is spent some time in New York.
Back back in the eighty square in my trench coat and going to the movies before, before Disney got ahold of it.
No.
Oh, that Giuliani.
He really makes my face red.
When I think about it, I would have voted for Dinkins four terms in a roll.
Keep those prostitutes coming.
So the best thing is, you know, in Terminator we you know, we have the cool effect where when you transport down to earth or transport back in the past, they have that, like, you know, cool.
Everything burns, you're naked, you get your butt shot.
For some reason, they go in tow water, screaming their heads off.
This is great.
Likes Fennelly.
Thoreson doesn't sell it as well as Venter does.
Like Venter again out of this pond or whatever it is just like an andi looks like when Charlie Sheen falls down in platoon Or is it Willem Dafoe put his arms?
Yeah, it's kind of like that, but just jumping out of water, and he's a gay.
Also weird.
Poor Pa's like he's a fucking bulbous head.
You know what he looks like and wet in the first X Men movie.
When Bruce Davidson, like, kind of turns into a mutant and then just jelly collapses, he looks like that kind of.
But it's just Jessie Venter.
A wet, which is amazing.
There's no special effects.
It's just him.
Slow mo jumping out of a pool.
I love it.
I missed Christmas because I was a Damien Lee's pool.
Thank goodness it was a heated pool, though It gets really cold in Ontario sometimes.
So the movie has to take a little bit of, Ah, roads pit stop here, and this is where things get really interesting.
So, you know, we get some narration for the mother about, you know, like like we said, like the kid's a mute, but he's really nice, and he's a loving kid, but he's been having some problems at school, cut to a parent principal conference and on one end of the table is the mother of Little Little Tommy.
And on the other end of this table is Principal Rick Latimer, as portrayed by Jim Belushi in the film.
The principal is also portrayed by Jim Belushi in this movie Abraxas, Guardian of the universe.
He's reprising his fuckin roll.
Look on what fucking planet was this a good idea?
It's so distracting and unnecessary.
And you're just watching this movie with a bunch of nobody's, and then you're like, Well, here's the biggest nobody of them all.
Jim Belushi.
What's he doing in here on Star Power, Man?
And you know, it's a weird like his.
He was married to this woman at the time, and she was in ah, bunch of his movie.
She's in taking care of business canine until he kicked her out of the car for giving him directions.
I don't need your GPS telling me where to go loud mouth.
Oh, it's difficult because I was just about to do it.
It's difficult to try and do in evolution right after a year of it.
Jura.
It's tough, it's yeah, are bad impressions are mixing together?
Yeah, no one on this show is Mel blankets all I'm going to say, but so it's weird.
So she's like, So what are you saying is wrong with my kidneys like well, the thing about it is I think he gets bullied all the time because he doesn't say nothing like a dweeb because it's great.
He's a real asshole in this scene because this thing is like, you know, this is a normal school for normal kids, you idiot, Shut out of it.
Also, how did you go from being the principal of a high school and like a tough California neighborhood to wherever the shit Canada this is supposed to be?
What kind of a transfers that fucked up that bad after the principal happened?
Well, he killed six kids in that movie like this.
Yeah, I got to go north or else I'm going to get the chair.
It's good, um, because I was heralded as a hero for approximately seventy two hours, and then they kicked me out of the state, gave give.
The gave the United States the twenty three skidoo, and it's great because she's like, Well, did you ever consider telling these kids to stop making fun of my son?
And he's like, Mrs matter of fact, I have not.
You're like, What?
This isn't the Rick Latimer I know and love Rick.
Vladimir would be on the side of this kid.
Tell lies other kids to stop fucking with exactly teaching him how to read or whatever else he does.
The principal, right.
No poem being a pigeon or something.
It's just It's so stupid that you write a poem about how mutants stupid you are.
And then maybe you can read it out loud to the class and talk like a normal person and not a loser.
You know what?
I've mollycoddled everyone for a long time.
You know what?
I got Victor Duncan almost cutting my throat.
So I'll tell you what, Thomas After school, you would be able.
Well, what's that?
Verner Herzog picture the land of silence and darkness.
I show you what a real mute looks like and you know they can't see either.
You got twenty twenty vision, Tammy, it's so ridiculous.
It's so useless.
And like having a character from another movie like it's just going to distract you.
It's just going to take Why doesn't Terry Gar from fucking Mr Mom show up?
Or like, maybe Rick Zelinski is there teach creating a fuckin help it Abraxas?
That's like What movie?
Um, I watched Brexit's Here's my shrink, Ray.
It just doesn't make any sense.
And now you're sitting there like, Okay, these two movies exist in the same universe.
That means while the principal is happening during the events of the principle Yeah, a brax.
This is out there finding things going to hunt down Cicotte Indus.
Sure hope he doesn't go to this downtrodden California high school.
I don't need to deal with street toughs.
You're also also I'll be the first say I prefer this to the Marvel universe.
Oh, yeah, universe too, man, You know, whatever.
You know, Winter Soldier this in that brexit and the principle, that is all I need.
And speaking of which, because of that, I was waiting at the end credits of this movie waiting for one of those marvel scenes.
A little teaser Greg was going to show you.
Where's Sam Jackson with his stinger?
Yeah, you're God damn right.
We're just trained toe wait for stingers.
Now, by the way, our way.
That's just you're not a lot of little movie theater, you like.
Wait, I'm I'm the asshole cause the credits are coming up and I'm trying to leave, which is kind of fantastic.
because now, like it's forcing us to revert back to politely watching the credits like everybody should, which is sort of great.
So you think then?
Okay, maybe.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe the legal matters for like, that's the only time we're in the school.
Except for the ending, I'm crossing my fingers hoping for sick, undisturbed come in and just blow him away does not happen like it's just like all right, end a parent teacher conference See next month.
And he's just out of use me.
I thought you were sick condition.
You're just a heap.
The vial of blood back in the line.
She can just be Rick Latimer, but there's a lot of Well, it's kind of like a comb ater you.
I'Ll show you the anti life equation.
See, that's that's what should happen.
He comes in, he goes up to Belushi, takes him by the head, and he's like, Are you the coal made?
And then his head does the scanners, and then we can, officially, and the Rick Latimer saga that it was you went out, went on top.
I guess you thought you thought it ended with.
Now he's the principal man and then he drove away in his motorcycle.
No know it ends with a fucking ten thousand year old alien blowing his head off.
Well, it's like Bill Murray only wanted Ghostbusters.
Three.
Think if he could die and it's all right.
I'LL Do outdo of Praxis, but I got to get my head blown off.
You got to kill this classic character.
What's that second issue?
You want to solve an equation?
Well, I'm a principle.
Oh, not their kind of equation.
Oh, no, not the life equation.
It's so ridiculous.
But then, after that scene is where we get the hilarious, sick, honest narration.
And now he's driving the movie.
It's just a dumb because he's like So I escaped from the jail and I was walking around for a little bit.
I got lost in the Ontario woods from fashion.
I found this movie and I decided to start narrating it onto the field.
No, is narrating this movie?
I guess I'll pick up the baton on the run with I was looking for a bathroom and then I accidentally found a voice of a studio.
Someone left the tape on my thoughts and feelings There's air, Brax, This is a finder.
But I found his movie.
It wasn't even here.
Let's let's do an audio book.
While I thought the best of times it was the worst of times.
So they find each other and we have another boring fight in the woods.
But what it it turns into is second ist leg interrupts this family camping trip so bad with this yuppie scum.
Oh, it's great.
And he just really lays waste to this family and steals their car.
Oh, by the way, did you guys notice like, Okay, so the this this stupid family, that's our camping.
Like the father does not want to give his keys over to Sikander.
Obvious reasons.
Sure.
So, like like alway, this guy's going to beat me up from my keys, so I'm just going to throw them in the campfire.
Right.
Classic mistake.
Yeah.
Then he just makes this fucking shitty kid dig it out.
We'LL stick because, like, cicadas doesn't blink because he does it.
He's like, pick them out of the fire.
This's not gonna pick it out of the fire is gonna make you pick it out of the fire.
But did you guys see what?
The key chain wass?
Yes, it said, Are we having fun yet?
Yeah.
You know, it was the classic party down line.
Are we having fun yet?
So?
And no, we're not.
Because we're watching Abraxas guardian of the universe so that the third part of this movie universe is the party down?
Yeah, it turns out it's a prequel to party down.
Yeah, exactly.
That would make about as much logical sense is going the principal to of Praxis that back to party down Well, while they're catering, Steve Gutenberg's party of Praxis is out there trying to find something.
Something is not right.
Sorry to interrupt your party, Steve Guttenberg, You, you caterers or really hilarious.
But I'm looking for second ist.
Did he get invited to your Hollywood Hills party or what?
Oh, no.
Is he in the porno episode?
This'LL bring the food is amazing.
Just like you say It's a condom.
Forget it.
I love this canna pays wth the on ly great thing to come out of the seat is it features Jesse Ventura riding on the roof of this car because he's trying to chase him down.
Jesse, the body Ventura and Dummy, the body dummy, which is just like Malik in these strapped to the roof.
It's ridiculous.
God bless him.
It's a mannequin with a rat tail.
Yeah, they got that down, man.
It hilariously just slides right off the car to its great use.
A professional wrestler, he was a Navy SEAL.
He can't hold onto a car roof for lunch side.
What are you doing?
Oh, no, that should.
Do you think so?
You think it's all Hollywood fun and games you can't hold onto the roof of a car.
The velocity alone.
We'LL toss it into the next state.
It's all fun and games till someone breaks a collarbone.
Portraying a Praxis is Here's something.
Yes, just one.
We're talking about spending with Orson, my favorite part of this movie and, you know, talking a little bit about comic book movies.
Hash tag.
Thorson as apocalypse because they're doing that new expert moving after days of future past.
It's Apocalypse spent.
Only Thurston would make an awesome apocalypse.
But here's the thing with that, though, does Apocalypse have lines to say?
Yeah, because then you're hiring somebody to double so chocolates lines is apocalypse seventy five years old?
No, because it's been a while since Praxis.
And yeah, I was looking a little older than you're thinking of nineteen.
Ninety spent only for also, you know, two thousand to spend.
Only Thorsen, right?
Like a gladiator.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, yeah, Wade.
But still, that was twelve years old.
Gladiator was like, two thousand.
He's sixty five years old.
I mean, you know, he's not going to fight anybody, man.
He just has to wear the suit.
I guess I'm Computers will do all the fight James Spader again to do the voice.
Maybe Ben Kingsley in there do the voice.
So he finally gets He gets the confidence of, like, the mother, they they encounter each other and, you know, it's like, Okay, I believe what you're saying because she remembers him from the last time because she remembers not getting her brains blown out.
S o.
He's like, I've come back to take care of Sikander once and for all.
And I may need your help.
First thing in track and down Second is I've got my VD, and they're like what he's like, why I got to use my VD to track down cicadas and it's totally supposed to be this fucking you know, STD joke.
And he's like, No, sorry.
I don't know why you're acting all awkward.
It's my vibration detector.
Yes, Isa Condos gives off a certain kind of vibration, and I'll be able to track him down and they're just all like who?
All right, so he doesn't have the clap or whatever I have.
What?
One of the lines was my box as VD?
Yeah, my box is riddled with VD.
I have tracker crabs that will go after second.
They confined to ready where Just go my minions and tracks a condom.
Just because I look like just cause I look like a man doesn't mean I am my box space backs.
Just play with my spaces box.
It's actually kind of a gun to set his bomb idea space box to fiddle with.
It's kind of around this time that we see the Rat Tail like actually makes its first appearance in the film becomes sentence.
Oh, no, my rat tails alive.
This is no good.
Well, the weird thing is, she's like, gets its own bench.
They have a Davis Eric Connor, Terminator scene, which I can't believe this shit, you know, But nobody He's gotta convince her.
And she's She is just bullshit.
Idea of, Like, I thought that that thing was a dream.
You know what I mean?
Nobody could, you know, I was starting to I doubt that.
That was really know, how could you ever doubt that was really?
You have a fucking kid.
You gave birth in five minutes.
We're being pregnant for nine months.
Absolutely not.
Yeah, it's just Come on, lady.
Yeah, it's just that it's being my imaginary son.
Thiss shit happen.
So, second asses in town, just ripping through citizens, man, he is just going on this killing spree, trying to find the co mater.
It's total.
Are you the key, master?
Every single person, by the way, And just to pad out the run time, we actually get, like, whole new set of characters that we deal with for way too long.
We get these two cops.
Oh, man.
H done dumber.
You know, the sheriff of this town is probably the best actor in this movie.
I thought, because he's just like he seems more natural listing everyone else's like struggling with the English language, the ones that are American born and the ones that aren't are equally struggling with the English language.
It's just the sheriff talking Teo to the deputy, right about like how we're so, you know, up here in the country were peacekeepers, and you're used to the city.
And, you know, you've got to get that out your head.
Yeah, like the little deputies.
A real like spitfire like, Come on, I want to go shoot somebody like there's a dude who part like worth this diner.
And the guy gets out of the car designer who parked this tractor here.
This is unbelievable.
And I was like, I thought this movie was about one alien chasing another alien.
Now it's about parking tickets.
Yeah, he goes of the diners, like who parked that shitbox tractor out here And this, like seven foot guys, stands up.
He's like, Do you have a problem with the way I parked my tractor?
And the sheriff has to be like, let him alone little kid, you know, he does this once a week.
He comes down from his farm to have breakfast or whatever he's like.
No, that's an illegal parking spot.
Oh, wait.
What is this, a recording studio?
Hey, now I could Matt married the movie.
It was my first day on the job in this sleepy Ontario town, but it's all that All those diner shenanigans air distracted by spend on ly thoreson Just launching this dude off of a motorcycle.
Oh, man, is it sweet?
That's a good action scene.
Like, this guy just pulls up and he fucking clothes lines this dude off this thing, he got a fucking tears through this whole town.
And just like, for whatever reason, like, it's beautiful areas because this metal thorsen can't remember who you impregnated.
It was five years ago is the one.
I was a little drunk.
Honestly, I've just broken out of prison about the pack off Red Dog beer and I drank it.
I put my palm a lot of places that night.
Three's women cars.
It's with my palm was everywhere.
There's a half so good.
This have dog.
Well, but what I love, though, is he's going around looking for this comb.
A They're like his son.
He knows it's only been five earth years.
Yeah.
Why are you going up to adults just goto all the kill.
The thing is, I think he doesn't know how Earth works because he's like, please, like twelve thousand years old.
So, yeah, he has no idea, although they just happen to look identical to how you look.
Yeah, exactly.
Come fire Lee.
Even when we start to believe in this movie, we don't get the space blood, which I think it's kind of bullshit, like Green, blue, purple.
Like anything, although, doesn't he like, I don't know if he grabs the main woman or someone else, but I think the countess does have a moment where he's just like I will crush your skull and brains like he's like threatening to crush people skulls, because he's like half alien police officer half Jason Vorhees.
So there's a lot of sculpt, a skull crush attempts.
I won't say skull crushes.
There's only a few of those years way more attempted skull crushings and threats of skull crunch.
So while this diner stuff's going on, we have an amazing scene where we learned, like what Tommy's deal is, and the whole thing is because he has this anti life equation inside him.
He's got magic powers sure varying degrees and all right, when everything.
We also get a little scene of him fucking up a bully, like like a really, like, finally pushed him too far in the bathroom, right?
Well, he's getting bullied by this one kid, and he makes the kid pisses pans on, which is like some sweet revenge.
And then we immediately cut to this bath where he's like, Hey, I don't know how you did it, but I think you made me piss my pants and he started.
I'm not terrified.
I'm just gonna pull you some more.
Yeah, so he starts pushing him again.
And then this kid like Carrie White's this dude into a bathroom stall and gives him a psychic wedgie.
Psychic, swirly or something.
Of course, because he bashes through the door of the stall and you hear the toilet flush because that's in this movie here.
Certainly my son giving swirlies and grade school.
Theo Cole made Ursa Kendall's Junior's got the medic Laurean's.
After the Wa Zoo makes him reach out with the force.
The power's kind of come to nothing like he'd has a little bit of stuff to do in the final fight scene.
But that's I mean, that's it.
There's no.
And also, until the very last shot of this movie, this kid continues to be mute.
Spoiler alert.
Sorry, guys.
Sorry.
You have, like, no idea what he's thinking.
You know, maybe he wants to go with succumb dislike, who even knows my dad.
My real dad.
Fuck!
You said, Fuck you, Abraxas.
My real dad's going Fuck you.
Uncle of Brack says, You know what, Toby way?
We're going to play catch.
Speaking of Uncle of Praxis, let's get to the weirdest scene in the movie, right?
So what happens in a baggy middle?
You know, you look much like Jesse the body of interns got in this movie.
So what happens is there's a There's another upper axis Sikander standoff.
And and you know this time second is got the better of me and impaled me with a broken floor lamp after he threw me on some exploding barbed wire when he jumped off the top turned Rachael.
Luckily, it barely scratched his fucking monitor body or whatever computer body.
The weirdest thing was the iron Sheik was supposed to be the special guest referee, but that he turned on me, too.
I really didn't see that coming.
I thought the Sheikh would take his responsibilities more truthfully.
After a bunch of folding chairs to the head thie ads Air box is like, Yeah, I could fix you yet You're fine.
All right, let's go on with the movie's So the answer box like So he's got this hole in his gut and, yeah, I got it.
I got to take a little bit of time to recuperate.
So he's hanging with this lady, like at their house, you know?
And all the sudden, there's just this scene where ve interest is in this bed.
He's all tucked in, but I'm sure he's got his shirt off and is clean off, and you can see that, like, belly wound and everything.
And then the kid comes in and he's like, Oh, hey there.
I didn't see you come in.
Well, since you're here, you want to come sit up with me and I'll tell you a story about two men and you're like Wait, what?
They were partners once one was Nema Praxis That's me and the other one's David.
Second is they were both the bravest, the bravest transformer cops in all the land.
It's also even weirder because actually wrote that the introduces this as a story about two men who were partners And what once wass it is no longer, you know, what's the weirdest part of that this scene like?
All right, so the little kid comes in.
He's like, Hey, want to want to sit up with Angela Praxis?
And I just got done putting coconut oil all over my packs and it's really a thief.
Ghost.
Weird, uncomfortable.
Part of this thing is that there is a brass bed frame in the back of it.
Because that is a sex bed frame like you can'tjust That's not an old lady sleeping that shopped in the hole down to you.
Want to go ahead and handcuff on Clipper axis?
Theo?
No, no, don't work.
Don't worry, Timmy.
There a their their furry little pink handcuffs.
Okay, Timmy, You ever see the film something wild?
Okay, It's an earth movie that came out two years ago.
Our safe word is cold, mate.
Against the safe word is the anti life equation.
Better tell me.
Pretty convenient.
Your mod installed some mirrors on the ceiling above this bed.
This story is going to get really fun.
God, what does that say about her?
It's just so it's so weird.
He just sits up and like they're just sitting in bed together and he's talking to him and it's just tough.
Tell him.
Oh, I used to love succumb dish once, but that's all that's all over now.
He went to the dark side.
You could say he decided to become a SCIF because since we're stealing words we don't own, I read shit.
It's not like Lucas is ever going to make the prequels anyway.
Nineteen ninety.
That's it's a long way's off, then This kid has never looked more thankful.
There's a part where the moms, it's like Tommy, where are you?
And he's like, Oh, fucking thank God, I would call out, but I'm a mute because I'm fucking Hafsa Candace, you know the big the big bonus for me and the big boner for you.
No one can hear you scream because you can't do it and the mother comes.
Then it's like, What are you two up to?
And she's totally fine with it.
This big, hulking creep was telling him about the legends of the city.
There's another awesome part like he's staying at this house for a really long time, you know, And out in the dish washes there's There's one part when they were on the drive to the house, where he notices that, like the dumb little sheriff's deputy kind of has a thing for any, asks where he's like.
So, is he a mating partner of yours?
He's like, What now?
He's just an idiot.
He's like, Oh, that's cool.
So then they're hanging out and like, he's going to get up to like, I don't know, take a shit.
Whatever he's dicking, jiggle, butt cracks, it is based job.
I had a lot of Abraxas brand chili before I left home.
I gotta practice.
There's a bunch of diamonds and my toilet.
That's how I go.
Pretty painful.
I literally shit diamond.
You're telling me these air worth something to you?
You humans don't convert carbon energy into priceless diamonds, so he's getting up to do whatever.
He opens the bathroom door, and she's just getting out of the shower.
And there's the greatest, like Jesse Vitor like mouth a gay plague.
Wei don't have those on the other end of the galaxy.
Hominy, hominy, hominy.
Now you say that like a robot.
Wow.
I got myself a pretty stiff space boner.
Oh, no, My space crabs aren't here to protect way Got such a bad space boater.
My my arms glowing pretty bad.
Oh, it's ready.
That blue that Wow, I never I never seen that shade of science before.
From the planet of the Rosy poems is that he's like, Well, I guess I better be going to bed And like he goes that always you just see this light, Follow it our way.
I'm asleep.
Nothing.
I'm definitely asleep.
That's just my nightlight.
Brax is what are you doing that walk along?
While all this, like sexcapades stuff is happening, we get treated to a scene where sikander skank.
It served at a restaurant like he goes and he sits down.
And these waitresses are like, Ah, that table is all yours.
And you could just see him sitting there like, uh, I just want to get a tuna salad sandwich.
None of them.
None of them will agree to serve me because I creep them out.
I thought I thought this world it's more progressive than that s so so one of the women come over and show him the menu is like, Oh, you order something from here And she points to like the breakfast section.
He's that good.
I will have that.
Bring me that.
What did that creep order?
The whole breakfast section?
So they bring him everything on the menu for breakfast.
He eats and all.
They bring him the bill, and he's like, I didn't order this.
She's like everyone gets one and he's like, OK, and he just eats.
It walks out.
That was written by me.
That scene, and usually just it with just even on his off days would come and watch me work.
And we did that twenty times because Jesse kept laughing.
It's so funny.
Do you know the kind of dump you take after each twenty pieces of paper?
I didn't know at the time, but they're probably should've stopped swallowing after Damien called cut, but I just I refuse because I have method and I was followed that paper every time did turn into a diamond.
Yeah, it's just silly.
I mean, also the weird thing about just a kind of Pulp Fiction a bit the at the end of that scene where you know he sees her in the bathroom.
He gets all hot and bothered, and she comes in and she's kind of turned down by this hulking creep that may or may not have molested her son.
I mean, have you seen that rat tail?
And it's glistening in the moonlight is this one?
It's a really bad cut because she goes in is a hey and it cuts.
And you don't know if they had sex like you don't.
I mean, like we had sex that night guaranteed.
That would have been in my director's cut, and I would have put in a sex scene between this lady and a Praxis.
Oh, man.
Jim Belushi was off camera the entire time.
Totally Sperling the mood.
She had sunburn all over stomach.
I'Ll tell you that the next day That's weird, right?
What is this racist policy about pulling out?
I better flick off the light switch before it's too late.
We're going to be dealing with two cold maters.
Next thing you know, then I'm going to really be up shit's creek.
I can't pay for that got the Brexit spinoff sitcom called My three Co maters.
What?
Not one of them could say a fucking word.
If the show ever goes off the air, we'Ll just end the galaxy anti life equation.
I mean, I guess at this point I mean, like, coma, condescend, apologizing all the bullshit words in my brain right now Sikander gets it in his head as well.
I've been killing all these adults for no good reason because it is drip work.
He kills a bunch of people in there, and it's like, Oh, you know, I should probably go for a kid.
So he goes into the the grade school that Tommy works at works that goes Teo was also the janitor watching him on, and he you know, he goes into a class.
It was like If someone doesn't bring me the Komodo in ten minutes, I'm going to kill all these children and I'm like, All right, maybe we're getting a have start here.
Let's see where this goes.
On that note of tell me working at the school, I imagine that's like Jim Belushi's like punishment for like, Oh, yeah, you don't want to say nothing Well, how about this?
Now you're the janitor.
You don't get to learn multiplication tables until you mop up that vomit.
And you know you don't want to be the general.
Just she show.
Yeah, you know, you can't feel it.
I guess you're gonna clean it and show me all ears.
Yeah, that's him.
Like saying like, Okay, this is the type of job you're going to get us a mute, you know?
Really, which is, you know, terrible.
And somehow a practice gets hip to it.
He's like, Oh, fuck.
The school should have thought of that in the first place.
Wow.
Both me and Sikander simultaneously drop the ball on that one.
And also at this point in the movie, like, speaking of, you know, a second act rat tail Nobody wanted.
I didn't need the third act comic relief that comes out of nowhere.
Which is the The answer box starts getting into the act.
The answer box starts getting mouthy to Ventura, and it's just like the hey, shut up over there.
And sure box.
And it's like, Where is this coming from?
And where is it going?
He's like, you don't get to say anything unless I tell you to say something, understand?
And it's like Fuck yeah, like Tze voiced by Doris Growl, you know, and he's just getting lip from this thing, which is in when you're acting and out.
It's It's Ventura just arguing with his forearm, which is where the device is located on him.
Also, speaking of comic relief, though, these cops are all over the place.
Oh, yeah, there's a thing where, like, cicadas comes up to him on the street and they shoot him a couple times or something like a newsy.
The little mousey guy takes out an Uzi, and I know you're not scared by this handgun.
How about this?
And he pulls this Uzi out, blows this dude away on this like quiet, sleepy town street.
And then, you know, so Candace gets back up and they scream and run away.
But then cicadas gets the machine.
It's very part of the movie is kind of like interesting weapon and like kills thirty people its way.
Don't have this where I come from, just laying waste to all these people.
It's one of the first few times that a car blows up.
There's absolutely no way bad He shoots like the windshield and it lights up like a Roman candle.
Taking a note from Charles Bronson movies.
I guess so.
You know now we're kind of getting the last act where it's just Abraxas Visa, Candace.
Yet again they fight like four times and the fight scenes get slower and slower really is like a wrestling match where they're just getting tired of the ring.
There's a lotta holding out each other.
Let's just breathe your for seconds A gun This?
Yeah, I got you in a headlock for twenty minutes.
It wait, You just stand there.
I'll go work the crowd a little bit I'll get him pumped back up because no wrestling match can ever be under twenty five minutes Having the fuck forbid exactly.
For whatever reason.
Like the last four months, I've seen, like, three wrestling matches, which is like one hundred percent more wrestling matches that I've seen in twelve years.
They're all twenty two minutes long with whatever you're doing, it's insane.
You and I were watching a bootleg wrestlemania stream and they're like, What are we doing?
It just it goes on forever.
Let's just get to it.
We're in the age of YouTube, baby.
Five minutes or less.
So what finally happens is Sikander finally gets this kid.
He actually gets the kids and runs off with him.
To where else?
An abandoned factory.
Not unlike the Terminator.
Exactly.
Right or one or two.
I think that was actually a working factory that they then the workers fled from once they saw all the shit.
Well, t too had not come out yet.
That's all righty.
Two years, right?
If it had, we would have definitely had molten fucking lava in this.
Oh, yeah.
Now you're actually you know, Seymour about Terminator one.
You're right, because that did involve a time travel.
We're getting the woman knocked up.
This's Yeah, it's all there.
It's all the Terminator one.
Yeah, because Terminator was six years before this movie, so it's definitely we know what we're doing here.
We're fighting in this factory, and all sorts of Chinese fireworks are going off and there's an awesome pop song.
Oh, it's just what?
What's the lyric to it?
I am power, something like and it's so inappropriate for what we're watching because it's like this dark, gritty factory.
They're fighting each other.
And it's It's a lot of hilarious, out of focus close ups of both of their faces, you know, with like a big, meaty hand going in front of the camera.
And this woman who's been like a main character, sir is completely left out of the third act of this movie.
Yeah, it was just the two of them in the kid.
She is.
No Sarah Connor.
No.
And the kid a tte this point, like he's kind of realized like, Okay, I can kind of control these powers a little bit.
So all the all the pyrotechnics that are happening, it's this kid, like being scared of spindly Thorsen and like making explosions happen all around him because he's like freaking out and everything.
And they just have this this big old bear fight spent.
Only Thoreson throws a chair at this kid and the kid's sets the chair on fire, which is kind of funny, which then starts like a fire in the hole factory.
You were really just burning down the house here for this third act and you know, you know, finally, Abraxas gets the better of second is and he's holding him.
And he's like, because, like, you can't kill me, it's against your programming.
Remember, you're going going to lose your job because for whatever reason, I could murder a thousand people.
But you killing me is out of the question.
You know what second ist I don't give a damn that you have those diplomat license plates.
I'm going to take your life right here.
I mean, and I am against the death penalty as the next guy.
However, if an alien from another world can bring about the end of the earth and all you have to do is take this fucker out, you're killing that guy seriously, Just just just just ended and just do it and we don't even mention one of cicadas is more horrific.
Crimes on this planet is he finds some dude and he just blows his brains apart.
He blows his head off with the answer box.
Yes.
So there are a couple had explosions.
Just want to mention it.
Well, because, you know, this is it's a Canadian movie, just like scanners.
We love blowing heads up.
I'm just gonna do it.
So he in the worst or the best example of terrible special effects.
I should say he blows up Second is his head by crushing him.
But it's this weird, like the screen goes dark and you kind of see like a bunch of what looks like galaxies popping out of the screen.
There's supposed to be, like, really lame explosions.
They look like nineteen ninety five screen saver.
What we did was we just took the shot from Star Wars, where the death star explodes and put it on.
Second is his face.
Lucas can Lucas can touch us.
I don't care.
Look, a short Jack Kirby.
We changed.
We changed it enough.
We put some toasters with wings flying out of there.
It was fine.
You know, when the original scripts a condom was supposed to be murdered by a bunch of colorful tubes, But it turned out it proved too expensive, and we had to cut it.
So I just crushed his skull with my barrier.
Luckily, spread all Thorsen gotto Gatto, a twin brother.
I actually killed this kind of real crushable head.
It was like a stale water melon.
You think that that was Charlotte, but it wasn't.
I killed that big Dane right?
there right then and there It popped like a child's water balloon.
It took me really a back.
So he's dead and they're like letting like, the upright citizens brigade calls up.
And they're like, Hey, you were right the whole time.
That took two seconds.
And now the universe is totally not in danger anymore.
And what would be the punishment?
Would he let get on Abraxas probation?
Like what?
What are you going to do?
Take my chaser badge?
Oh, shit.
They're going to fuck with my pension.
No finders parted under bed.
Yes, When I retired forty five thousand years I'LL have i'll have a half pedj.
Well, he actually asked him to retire now because he's decided he wants to stay on Earth and rear this child some more, right?
He's like, I got to be the guardian Are this kid now Just in case?
Because you know, someone else is going to come looking for this kid and he needs round the clock surveillance, right?
He he says that they needs to be a find her on this get at all times.
So there's not another set Conditions that Oh, I'm no longer a finder I'm in the private sector now.
Just watching this kid.
I work for my galaxies version of Blackwater Independent contracts on Lee, please.
And they're like, it's another bullshit thing where he's communicating via his forearm walkie talkie.
And they're like, I don't know, Abraxas.
We kind of need you back here.
And he's like, Yeah, but remember, what almost happened with sick cond is and they're like, Yeah, you're right.
OK, you Khun, stay there.
That's cool.
And all I'm thinking is like, he's so protective of this kid, right?
Flash forward to Tommy's, like senior prom.
Now, you better be back here.
It said that the dance is over with at eleven.
Thirty PM You bet your Bob I'm going to be sitting up waiting for you because you know what you go part in at one of those after prom parties and you take one shot of Goldschlager.
Next thing you know, you got some condoms breathing down your throat and then we're going to be in a real jam.
Buddy, I'll tell you why that won't ever happen because the U.
S government would dissect of Brexit slice him up.
So I guess the Canadian government Excuse me.
The Mount.
The Royal Mounties will take him away.
Take them to their area.
Fifty five.
Man.
I wish there was it.
Abraxas too.
We're, like, sure succumbed asses back Because why not?
And he just like like posing is a gym teacher.
Thomas, you want, you do?
Your squad's better this way.
What?
Watch watch, Mr Sikander.
No, it's no relation.
I just happened to be from Norway.
Okay, That didn't work away ten years and be our high school guidance counselor, you know?
God damn, it's a condition.
We know it's you.
That's a really bad mustache.
Don't call Mrs Condoms because I tell your child he can't get into Julianne.
He doesn't have the talent.
I'm not the sick condos.
My name was Fund on this.
I'm Shari.
You're standing here looking at me straight face.
Tell me your names for Tanya.
This?
Yes, there the car.
Hey, Barbara, Was it just bearded?
That real estate agent look eerily like sick.
E don't I know it's highly unlikely as I've killed him four times, but I have a feeling that that real estate agent, maybe he'd have been cut dish.
Although you beat Mr Jake well, Jack understood.
Have a good deal on that.
That four bedroom we were looking at.
It's time for us to expand as we got four co maters.
Now, you know, it's not that I didn't vote for him because I thought tremendous would make a bad mayor.
I'm just pretty certain it was sick on distal whole theme.
The last thing we need is for second is to take over this town because then he's going to be passing all sorts of anti upper axis legislation.
And then I'm going to be in a real jam.
Ah, a lot of coal mater quarantines.
They're kind of pushing a camp buddy, and it's going to be only you and your little brother's skip because they're the only co maters in town.
Uh, that is Abraxas, guardian of the universe.
Would anybody recommend this movie?
I would.
I mean, I'm daring you to find it, but just bucket doubled their You know, it's it's a lot of fun.
It's definitely it's not a movie to watch by yourself.
Get a bunch of friends together, have a good time, a bunch of bad Jesse, the body impression exactly.
Just throw them all It's a great thing to have on a party.
I think you know what I mean.
Like what?
You're just because you can't just walk around, do some stuff, come back like, Oh, is that him on top of the car?
That's fun.
You're definitely not going to want to listen to it.
We're going totally fine.
I would agree with Steve.
It's, you know, it's a light recommend, you know, Put it on in that context and you'LL you'LL have a ball.
Yeah, that's Ah, that's Ah, the same thing I'm doing.
It's a three way tie of yeah, if you can find it And you're the kind of person who just puts movies on mute at parties, which is totally for the party I want to go to, Ah, that is Abraxas, guardian of the Universe from nineteen ninety, Directed by Damien Lee.

Wake me if I'm wrong.
But I think at least one of those two house painters might have been Sikander.
It's possible both of them were sick under.
But, you know, I'LL bet my baby one of them was definitely psychotic.
This here's another thing I'm just going to put out there in Honey, I'm No, I know you're going to go up and down about this, but that guy that was volunteering at the church bazaar pretty sure that was sick.
Oddness.
You don't just operate a bingo table with a name like tremendous Abraxas is looking Arusha where this whole life now just forever and ever there may or may not be good this after you that's what he is like.
I'm imagining that that this woman he's probably gonna marry will just die and he'LL live another ten thousand.
Oh, weird.
This new alien space race.
I think one of them might have been a second issue.
No, the planet got taken over by mostly repped aliens.
I'm pretty sure that one reptilian was definitely sick.
Cotton is.
He keeps looking at me cross.
You know how.
And I don't want to go back to that supercuts toe.
Have them maintain my rat Dale, because I'm sure one of the barbers and there is definitely set gotten is honey, Honey, honey, stop making those cakes.
