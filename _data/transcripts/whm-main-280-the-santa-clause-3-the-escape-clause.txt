I'm Andrew Jew Pin, Stephen said.
Chris, Kevin, Eric Cisco and we hate movies.
Theo Wait.
Movies On the Side Show Network Thank you for tuning in.
As always, this is our Christmas episode, and we're talking Santa Claus.
Three.
The Escape Clause from 2006 directed by Michael Lembeck, who also directed The Santa Claus, too.
And so did he do say, That's just it's his region.
So when when is the prequel?
Uh, that's just like Tim Allen being an abusive father that again watch the 2nd 1 all the way through.
Does the Joker show up in that one?
No, but there is a fascist toy in that I do remember the toy clone.
It's pretty uncool.
It's like a robo Santa.
Yeah, like he's like, Oh, there's the Mrs Claus is like, Hey, you got to get married and get a Mrs Claus.
Yeah, we don't want any single Santa's going around, so that's a problem.
So he's like, Oh, but I have to, which is also a part of this music.
I have to watch these elves like 24 57 I didn't know What the fuck are up to say?
There's a real micromanager in these movies, so it's like, uh, Spencer Breslin builds a robot that winds up being a fascist.
At the end, he's wearing a beret and like military uniforms, it's a bit we II so hopped up on cocoa.
It's a really uncomfortable scene to watch.
I don't like that Frankenstein fascist in Mr Mania or whatever.
It's actually really close to that, but I don't think these movies know what there's think.
So, yeah, I can see that with ah, despite never seeing the 2nd 1 and only seeing the 1st 1 once when I said the 1st 1 quite a bit.
Oh, I was on a couple times, aviators to we had.
I believe it was a clamshell VHS case that's like Disney vaults Vaults is the real deal.
And that was my big green.
Uh oh, really?
VHS tape was in the clam shell.
You had the big did.
What's the Big Green is way ahead is your favorite movie.
Yes, it's my very favorite movie blade.
Then the big Greed and then Manchester by the sea where they execute Michael Clarke.
Duncan?
Yes.
And now it's where the fact it from the sandlots plans soccer.
That's why I like that.
Yeah, that exists.
I need to see this.
Yeah, you know what?
Hey did.
Oh, definitely.
I mean, covers his nards, selling it on the nut trauma.
What are they gonna do?
Not trauma is a big selling point.
I will see it not trump in the 19 nineties.
Give me a break.
I wish there was not trauma on this moon.
There isn't.
Which is surprising.
How do you make a shitty you know, pseudo family movie like this without not trauma?
So this is the third outing of Tim Allen as fucking Santa Claus suit.
And I can't think of a bigger fucking asshole to play Santa Claus.
I hate his fucking movies.
I hate his fucking dumb man.
Fucking horseshit!
Standup comedy.
But, Andrew, you don't find it funny that men are different than women because they are.
I ask anybody.
Hey, just ask anybody.
And this movie has to take a dump in my mouth from 2nd 1 because, like, as the opening Disney credits are going, you just get Tim Allen.
00 it is fucking douchebag toilet flushing grown noise that may.
Yet you've seen the first movie multiple times.
I was a stupid kid back then.
I'm not denying that I saw multiple seasons of home.
Oh, yeah, I was on the home improvement bandwagon way, too.
Oh, yeah?
Did you get up to where Mark became a golf?
I sure did.
Tim Allen sure didn't know howto handle that always got makeup on.
Jill, is you Google.
Good game that was so disturbed because that was like a season was like my son guy wait.
Even though he's got, he's coming to the football game, Maybe there's hope.
Yeah, and it's checking out the women's butts.
What do you think about that?
Wilson the neighbour?
Oh, he tricked American to doing that show again.
It's been secretly on the air for like, eight years.
Man standing, last man standing.
Wait, that he's gotta sit.
Come over the years and years, it's been, I think, multiple like eight.
Maybe it's been a long neck.
Travis, the worst actress in history, playing the wife Well, you got to play off to me.
Oh, Jessica, that's Holy Toledo.
So What?
What is that about?
It is the last.
This It's the same thing.
Yeah, but that's the thing, right?
It's like, Is he the last man's man standing?
Oh, my fucking lord, Can you help it?
Tim Allen?
Because it's him and a bunch of lead.
It's a house run by women and just be, Oh, no, they didn't They didn't do it and it's been secretly on for years and years.
It's like ABC.
You can't fucking figure out like another black ish or something else to put it in there.
No, it's got to be the white ish Qianjiang Show get cancelled.
Oh, I hope so, yeah.
Did Dr Ken?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that went far away.
He's a gimmick that I grew tired of half a decade ago.
You finally represent America, Andrew.
So after he do, Shelly says, uh, we get this thing where it's like, uh, Elizabeth.
What's the actress's name?
She's on Lost.
Elizabeth Mitchell.
Yeah, she's Mrs Claus.
She's also Mrs Closing.
The second movie right there is Castor.
Yes, she is on.
She's like teaching like school children or school elf children.
They're like 80 years old, right?
That's the gag like all the elves are, there's no way to tell.
Well, hold on.
There are Elliot Gould, Elliott Gould.
They should be wearing Elliott Gould glasses, though, that Elliott Gould, Ocean's 11.
How they're not been a Christmas movie about Ocean's 11 and I need 12.
I'm gonna need 11 El.
I'm gonna need a reindeer.
Get the reindeers together.
They gotta rob the North Pole.
I would watch it.
Copy.
Mark covered.
We hate movies.
A heist movie.
On Christmas, it's the ocean's 11 copyright dude.
I would have the clamshell the hold on Steve, That's not safe enough.
What you've got to do is put this MP three in the mail and mail it to yourself on the postmark.
Don't open it.
Okay, let's just pause this road trip over to the patent office and do it.
Get this.
Get this on paper.
Probably exists anyway.
Lifetime probably already did that.
Oh, probably do the slew of, like, just shit Christmas movies.
That's what I'm watching this month, man, which is amazing because, like when when we were of a younger age, it was like what?
It's a wonderful life fucking Christmas vacation miracle on 34th Street Christmas story, which I can still watch out.
Andrew, you're sounding a little bit like Tim Allen right now.
Yeah, well, thank God none of them start a fucking woman of Jimmy Stewart ran that movie.
I read that he was the boss of the movie, The Last podcaster standing.
No, my point is like I just feel like now there's just 1,000,000 Christmas movies that start insane.
Christians, Christmas movies that start pets that can talk.
I mean, like the sub genres of Christmas movies.
It's out of control.
This Santa buddies, one Santa buddies, too.
Santa Paws Center bunnies.
Five.
A new beginnings, this porter or what?
Thes.
They're dogs.
All the ones that are made by, like, the sub lifetimes.
Like the ones that don't even have that banner.
The sub.
Yeah, you're always drawing DVDs like the family house entertained Sunshine Pictures and all that bullshit Mar Vista Entertainment.
Yeah.
Yeah, and they all star a star.
Fucking Joey Lawrence and Melissa Joan Hart.
Somehow Price Christ like pictures.
Yes, I saw one just this last week on Lifetime, which was It's the guy from Angel Christian Kane who's weirdly who is Christian.
King is that beefy dude with long ago.
Now he's got short hair.
Yes, that's right.
I hated that character, some other lady, and basically the, uh it's about a baby angel that comes home for Christmas.
And guess what?
What?
From college?
They're about to get divorced.
And some baby angel is like You guys can't get divorced.
It's a little girl.
Sick five, baby, Look at you.
But the gag is the the angel is actually there.
Miscarriage twist ending its there.
Miss Carrie.
Oh, my God.
Why don't we do that way, Steve?
What did they name their miscarry?
They didn't name it.
I think enabling Erica is so that miscarriage named itself in heaven because they gave it.
They gave it a proper Mike Pence funeral.
Well, as then it went to have, as is the law way, just like it Was this the one you were telling me?
There's some, like, ghostly narration.
Is that this one?
No, that's the gene.
Been a movie, which is all right by the ghost of jump in Iran.
That sounds like a good Christmas, I think.
Didn't you get murdered around Christmas?
And it was It was like I was unwraps its It's like I believe diehards.
That Christmas is that you got people who will fight you on that, though it's like, What are we talking for?
So she Elizabeth Mitchell, who played the president elect in the purge election year bythe um, yeah, she was against the purge, by the way.
Just just That's why they wanted to kill her.
Exactly.
E.
I want to now in the next purge what we'd be like.
What we can't have the purge be great, gets fucking butchered.
I all I know is I like to go around and where a pig match could slip people.
So, uh, do this man has made millions off of barking like a hog.
They should call all beers America.
I just hate it.
So, uh, she, Abigail Breslin, by the way, is like, tell us a story or something.
I don't even know.
The frame is just like I'm bored with elf math.
Why don't you tell us how you got knocked up?
And by the way, they definitely say, baby, Klaus is so gross.
Because here's the thing.
Third Santa Claus movie.
Fine.
Second Santa Claus movie.
You want to tell me a story about how Santa has to get married.
That's cool.
He's always had Mrs Clause.
So find the story of how he meets his Mrs Claus.
Fine.
But this movie saying is gonna have a baby, which means San has been fucking Santa Has semen live semen that could impregnate a woman.
I don't need to.
I don't need to be fucking thinking about Santa Fuck.
I don't understand why he has a kid.
Like what?
What happens to that kid?
Does that kid then grow up to be Santa, right?
That's good.
That's the problem that all Santas have been murdered.
That's the line of succession when when the oh, it's I it's Ed a piss, right, Chris, like kill your father and then have sex with your mother in order to become Santa.
You got the bloodline, so I don't know if Elizabeth Mitchell signed on for that whole story line.
But that's one of the things that problem bothers me about Elizabeth Mitchell.
Like the first Santa Santa Claus movie, is a body horror movie about how becoming morbidly he's like, Oh God, what's happening?
It's like thinner at reverse.
Is there is there because I haven't you guys.
Most of you re watched all of these movies.
I didn't get a chance to play in the 1st 1 Is there like him with his shirt off?
And it's a fat suit.
These jazz?
Oh, no, because it's the grossest way grossest thing in the fucking world is they do because he has to go to the doctor and like, the guy puts the fuckin I forget what?
Your stethoscope, death, a scope on his chest.
And the fucking thing says, don't don't don't, don't, don't, don't.
Hey, Sam, you have to stay overnight because you're gonna fucking die.
Chris Carr.
So But he does his body heart of like becoming morbidly obese can't shave his beard and all that.
It happened so fast that, like, that's gonna like.
That's like your organs are failing.
Exactly.
But when she becomes Mrs Claus, she doesn't get the white hair.
She doesn't get the round glasses.
That's right.
Tim Allen's fucking allow that.
Oh, I'm not going to be married to a fat old lady, huh?
Exactly.
He's fucking deals a goddamn George Romero Romero I saw recently, and he's one of the finished men you'll ever know.
I meant to say George Wendt friends Ford Coppola loved Frankie Board.
Go play a little bit on her worst day.
She has to be an eight.
So the student is, though, that she's basically like, you know.
So how did you get knocked up?
Also, how did you feel about Santa Claus virtually kidnapping you and tearing you away from your entire life?
And she's like, Well, it's a funny story.
You're like, weird Is Stockholm Syndrome.
Yeah, give up.
She was the principal of the school.
She gives up her entire career to become Mrs Clause, by the way.
Way to go, Tim.
Sound fucking your kid's high school principal, you walking cliche.
Not great.
And the weird thing is like in the second movie, he gets all skinny again because he goes back to Earth.
And, like I know you put the whole to attract a mate.
It's accreting.
This news, we'll know, isn't it like the back to the future photo where, like the longer he's there, the sinner and less bearded he was that right?
Like Superman in a red sun situation.
Crib off of back to the future.
A lot in this news, it looks like this.
This third movies back to the future to alternate timeline, but again.
So, like he's like regular looking to Melon, which is a fucking four at best.
But then he Frankie Ford Coppola's out, and she's like, Oh, I like that better.
Like, What are you talking about?
Yeah, you gotta take four Tim Allen, not a three friends is for That's the biggest she does.
She falls from when he's skinny and then he balloons back up, and then she's like, she's ready.
Thio, she's like, Oh, whatever.
Yeah, because she fell in love with skinny him.
She can accept fat, which is fine.
I mean, like, Hey, we've all plugged Have all run that trick on ladies, right?
Steve's OK.
Cupid profile actually had Robert Pattinson.
Ana, you just you forgot to take off the fucking Photoshopped water, Martin, Don't worry about it.
Hey, don't worry about it.
So she's pregnant.
We did this.
L it starts with a ah, false labor.
She'd almost goes into labor.
She doesn't have labor, which I can I don't need Mrs Claus with their legs and syrups getting fucking rushed through the north.
Hold one.
I watched the miracle life in high school, man.
I know what's gonna go on.
I don't want to think about what it would be.
It would be courageous if they win.
Like this movie would suddenly be kind of good.
Whoa.
If you saw Mrs Claus giving birth, you said she's sweating.
It's God.
We're really just animals.
You get that realization that moment, You see that disgusting sack that then becomes a person?
You're right.
That would make this movie better.
I want you to narrate miracle life.
Now look at that.
Disgusting sat here comes to sack coming.
That could be a commentary on Patriot Lord s O.
T.
Sounds like worried about it.
It just so happens to be his busy time of year, which is Christmas.
You know that, right?
00 Santa works on Christmas.
One guy.
He is such a micromanager, though.
Like he's like getting phone calls out the ass.
All this like these little details.
You can't blame him, though.
He has shitty middle management Lawrence Lawrence, who now hit puberty in the middle of all this.
Now he sounds like David Krumholtz, which I guess is what they were going for.
But because David Krumholtz is in the first movie, right?
Was there and he was great.
He put all those elves in line.
Here is a great question.
How do you not get David Krumholtz back for a movie?
It's a great maybe.
Numbers was going a little too hot and heavy at that way.
Okay, Yeah, I might have been something.
It must have been a bidding war.
And he's like, $80,000.
Hey, probably had already booked a cruise.
He's doing theater on a cruise.
It was his wife's birthday.
He just didn't want to deal with it.
I also just wouldn't want to be part of 1/3 Santa Claus movie.
Also entirely possible.
He was like, You know, isn't Harold and Kumar at that point, you know, they should have, like, professionally written him off.
They're like, Oh, man, uh, David Krumholtz elf got butchered last Christmas.
If he fell under the sleigh kind of right in half.
You're promoted.
Spencer Breslin.
Ever see a final destination down there on Earth?
That oh, roller coaster fell on him?
A slice from up real good.
I would like to believe that sand in the elves are watching in the final destination movies comes first.
Speaking of that, can we talk about the Hellmouth fireplace?
He has think the most important thing in the movie that's like my only note because it's bad enough, you see, like Santa's office.
And there's this gigantic fireplace made of Santa's face.
It is living rooms, and the whole of his mouth is where the fire goes.
But it's also like a gateway, and it was like, uh, like Opens and he can walk through it.
Fucking disgusting.
Son of the mask level graphics, It's also terrifying, like who has fired breathes fire like this confirms that Santa's magic is black magic.
It is devil magic, and I denounce it.
He also looks angry as fuck he looks like he's going to eat me.
I thought that somebody's fucking put a sword through David Boeri Ana said he was gonna go straight to hell.
That was That's how that shit should work when hell froze over, get Satan gained weight way moved some letters around, became Santa, thinks is an old theory.
Goes that Waffle House every morning.
Yes, this is why we have to say happy holidays, because do not invoke of the dark Lord.
Not on that.
It's disturbing.
And like later, Alan Arkin doesn't even remark on it.
I'm like, What the fuck is that?
Let's get into that now they have to.
For some reason, I was by the attention that much.
No, that's That's the motivation for everything that happens in this movie.
And then this happened for a reason.
So for some reason, his in laws have to go to the North Pole.
And that sort of what half of half of this movie's about?
Well, it's because she's like nine months pregnant and San is too busy caught up with work to give a shit about his pregnant wife.
So she's like, Hey, I need some help with all this How about inviting my parents, who you forbade me to see ever again, which is weird?
It's totally well.
And then the whole like loose justification.
He's like, Well, you know, honey, your parents will blab to everybody on the block about the secret of Santa, but they're old people around town saying, You know, my my son in law, Santa Claus doesn't get into the sanitarium quickly, but no one's seen this woman for years.
She's like David West gave it his wife, right?
Like this.
Like in hiding.
Is she dead?
Is she missing?
Who knows?
Oh, man, you get me a fucking picture in front of a newspaper with that lady, huh?
Holy it's every you because no, baby.
Look.
Nobody looks at milk cartons anymore.
It's every she's on every milk carton.
America.
Lauren Miscavige.
Well, II dude, I'm off milk, man.
I've been I've been, you know, a soy boy for a long time.
Why?
She keeps on being missing mass.
Nobody's buying milk anymore.
What do you from the fucking milk council they packed with vitamin D.
The jury?
It is a more that.
Especially in the winter.
Yeah.
So the parents are Alan Arkin.
Ah, and Ann Margaret, one and Margaret.
That's that's what you want.
Is your your cast member and Margaret who I didn't recognize until this credit.
It's just her name is Anne Hyphen Margaret.
Really?
That's what they didn't.
This movie anyway, it's in grumpy old men too, is it?
That was so weird.
I think that's how she's always been.
I But it also is super confusing.
Does that is that your first name or your last name.
I think that she's just and it's like Thio.
It's hyphenated and her full name is Ann Margaret Olson.
So it's just her first name and mark.
So if Johnny Depp just went by Johnny Yeah, well, yeah, I guess.
Or what's his middle name?
What's What's Johnny Depp's Middle?
I'll look it up right now.
Who could?
Who could care?
Who knows?
Johnny not rot to death yet by that Johnny, I got away with a domestic abuse step That there is a slight off the tongue Doesn't really just g o John Christopher in quotation marks.
Johnny Depp The second bythe So Johnny, Chrissy, Chrissy or a visiting with Stanley A smoking a joint with Santa Claus.
Oh, man.
Ah, and then I came up with the blob.
Um, so, yeah, it's like I want my in laws.
I want my parents to come up to be with me when this baby's birth.
So go get them.
Also bring up your ex wife, her husband and this child.
That isn't yours, because why not this whole thing about we're all fucking friends?
No, no, thanks.
No, no, I don't want that divorced.
Yep.
Remember that remember that when we got divorced that Scott Calvin, Only way this works and this might be the case, OK, is you know, they know he's Santa Claus, and it's a weird cult up there.
Okay, it's like Jonestown.
Oh, big time.
It was just like seconds away from mass suicide.
And it's just like, Oh, the leader.
We must please the leader.
So, like, everyone's fucking him, like Judge Reinhold thes dark nights of all, I do think it's a bit of like a nepotism thing.
Also, like, they just want a court.
Look at all the course.
Even Lucy will get some well and again, like in all these movies, it doesn't make any sense.
Why doesn't everybody know that Santa Claus exists?
Where are these presents coming from every morning and elves?
They're making them.
Yeah.
Why are all Christmas presents garbage?
You know what I mean?
Like, Okay, there's some nice stuff, but like a lot of it's just all wooden blocks.
You know what?
Why are they Chinese out?
Well, Santa Claus lore has never been able to really address why, you know, in these movies you're just making, like, little wooden race cars instead of stacking his fucking bag full of Sega Genesis cartridges.
He just can't do it.
You just gotta suspend disbelief.
No.
Also odd is Judge Ryan holds character is one of these 50 year old adults that's obsessed with Christmas.
Yeah, you can fucking tone that down a little bit.
Just a little bit grown adult, if you please.
With the sweater gags.
Like I get it, man.
It's funny that Cosby warship the sweaters.
And now everybody wears shitty sweaters.
Just the whole you talking about, Like the real life culture of bad Christmas sweater parties.
I just can't.
Do you ever get invited to one of those?
I've never knowed on an R S v p faster.
Even if I was, I feel like I'd spit in their face.
Who?
The hose.
The guy who asked me to come to a lesson.
You show up to a party?
Yes, solely to spit in those days was around the holidays, and I'd have I build it up in the elevator.
Ready?
Tow.
Have it.
So are you staying at this party or is it just sitting there?
Are you both wine?
You should bring what I will bring wine and he's not getting it.
Okay?
He or she?
Sorry.
Spit in their face in the drink.
One I'm not giving.
You know, it's this simple.
I go to the door, they answer, I spit in their face.
Say, fuck you.
Take my wine and get back on the elevator.
Question.
Possibly got a drink.
But in order to, like, be granted access to this party.
Sure.
There is the possibility this person won't answer the door.
You have to Then purchase the bad sweater.
No, I don't.
I have a way.
Well, you were nothing under it, dude.
At least bare chest his face.
Open it up, swing that dick and get out of there.
Or you could mix him and, you know, flick him in the whole Merry Christmas from MiGs.
That's a Christmas card.
When you thought what I was going to do, I know you're working.
You're working a pure flame.
You're working yourself.
You're doing the whole the whole system.
Their way Double.
Yeah.
Get ready for it.
You pull a double on them and I like that one, too.
Is like Wade Night.
Jurassic Park, God damn it.
Happy holidays.
How did that happen?
But the other thing that happens there like he goes first things first.
He has to go talk to the lead.
The league of What is it?
What's wrong?
They're doing the legal starting a journalist.
Sean Connery's there, you know, like the holiday team like three Council of Legendary figures, I believe.
Oh, wow, isn't that great?
Let's go through it.
So you got Alan Quartermaine.
Evil Invisible Man.
Dr Jekyll.
Mr Hyde?
No, it's Aisha Tyler as Mother Nature.
Mother Nature.
You've got Kevin Pollack is Cupid and he's, like, kind of naked.
Yeah, and fucking and grow money pellets.
No, that's the Easter Bunny.
No, isn't that the Easter Bunny is shitting Bunny Bell?
Why would shit Bunny?
I think he says he doesn't have any diapers.
He's wearing a diaper.
Kevin Pollack.
It'd diaper, which I just My skin is crawling and I'm here with my kids.
Smoke yourself, man.
I was hard as a rock.
Let's get through the rest of marketing this killer croc Harley Harley Quinn, that Mexican fire guy.
He's cool link from his elderly group, building the night thinking of the Nintendo Power gang or whatever that was Cartoon Captain, Captain and Captain and the game Masters S O U also have J.
Thomas who was fired from cheers for being on a radio show, saying that he would throw up after he kissed Rhea Perlman.
Right?
Perlman was like, Fuck that guy.
You're right.
Repeat, Rhea Perlman.
Fuck that guy.
You're right.
One of the most powerful people in television at the time.
We will fire this man, so he s o he's the Easter Bunny.
And disturbing.
It's disgusting on.
Then you have this guy art LeFlore who's like a big, gruff tooth fairy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is now Art?
Leflore is an interesting character because of all the movies have been definitely in half.
What was?
Wow, You've never been able to say that about anybody done a lot of flock like Oh, yeah, Zone troopers or something where he's like in World War Two and it comes across an alien or something.
I don't know anyone.
What is with this?
This obsession American culture has lately where it's like, What if the tooth fairy was there with homophobic?
Exactly.
Because in the last movies, ever.
Oh, actually, wait a second.
This fucking dude that directed this trilogy directed the Dwayne Johnson Tooth Fairy movie.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, dude, he definitely did.
Do you think he reached out Thio?
They're absolutely.
And Johnson didn't even pick up the fucking okay.
What's the what?
That's what's the most like the rock art Leflore.
Well, here's the question.
Did they originally develop the Dwayne Johnson Tooth Fairy as a Santa Claus spin?
All I saw Jesus Lord.
Yeah, because that would make sense if art the floor is like a big, gruff guy with the fairy wings.
Because in the last movies, like his thing is that why do I have to recall the tooth fairy?
And he won't remember Reservoir dogs and everything.
Shut up about tooth man.
Fuck it, dude, Man, that's a horror movie on Netflix.
You'll never select a one time The tooth on the tooth.
Man, I gotta kill your family.
Perfect on Then everyone's favorite.
Michael Dorn as the sand man holding.
Now here's here's what's tough, huh?
For me as a massive TNG fan.
Sure, hashtag we want Worf.
I love Michael Dorn and finding out that Michael Dorn is in this movie, I was like, Fuck yeah, That means Michael Dorn's working But, man, sometimes it's just better fucking given unemployment.
Jack, He can't be in comedy, you know, like, I can't do comedy.
You're saying, e I think he's the best part of this movie.
Yeah, okay.
I mean, that's not saying anything.
Sure, but Michael Dorn is the best part of this move.
I'm going insane.
There's no best part of this.
But can Michael Dorn do drama?
Hey, he knows Drama.
Michael Dorn played the president on one episode of Heroes, and I got so excited on the rest of heroes happened.
Like, how is how is it you're making this fucking dumb heroes show?
And you know all these, you know, comic book nerds and Star Trek nerds.
Everybody's going to be watching it.
You have fucking Worf himself playing the president of the United States, and then you're like, Nah, scratch it.
Never again.
What a tease.
I was so pissed.
I'll tell you one thing.
Michael Dorn wasn't busy.
Michael Dorn is not busy for heroes.
He was ready.
Well, maybe they were like, Oh, shit.
We've got George Takei on here.
We can't have two Star Trek, but that Michelle Nichols was on it too.
you know, he might have had to go to his any short factories.
Make sure we want Worf to you.
Sure, he's kind of like Santa Claus.
Yes, yes, he's got.
He's got elves that nobody can know where this T shirt factor is.
His elves, they're called Trekkies.
I always live in these.
I was like, Well, the we want Worf guys And I'm like, Are you?
I don't know.
I think it's a bigger operation than we realized.
Oh, my God, It's gotten so big.
Follow the money I want to get to the bottom of We want dwarf man.
So it's like the insider and then And the head it's It's Michael Dorn like a Mike fucking Dorn being free just walking outside of a revolving door and take a deep breath and central park or whatever.
That would be awesome.
It would be.
I bet you Michael Dorn can do that too.
About your door.
Incan do drama.
I know.
I guarantee it.
Get him in a Michael Mann movie.
Oh, yeah.
Do it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He would definitely do it involved Michael Mann as well, Even after black.
I didn't see that is about I kind of like I liked it, but it made no money.
We're like hacking something in China.
Oh, yeah, it's a hack in action action.
It's kind of good.
Yeah, you know, I'm not saying it's kind of great, right?
Put it down.
It's kind of good.
Look, we've waited too long to talk about Martin Short.
Yeah, last putting counsel.
It's all like.
And this council doesn't make any sense at all, eh?
It's mostly American holidays, Which whatever.
Where was G Fox and all that?
What is with Mother Nature, though?
Like Don't, It's great sentiment.
But do we don't think of Mother Nature on par with Santa Claus?
Well, that's the thing.
There's like holiday icons.
And then there's just garbage.
Peter Boyle is father time, not knowing what he's doing.
The Peter Boyle died the same year this movie came out.
They were fucking propping him up with a broom behind his back.
He was dead.
That was all a tr Oh, my God.
They turned into a puppet.
Just someone else doing it.
Yeah, And also has anybody even used the term father time since 1973.
What's no.
I use it all the time.
So young people on the bus Come on, Father time.
Yeah, got an airplane to catch.
I love I love say that when I shove people well, Chevy C Eric in the street like it's Eric.
You'll shove you.
He's a shover.
I'm a tough customer.
So but like the sand man falls into that, that should d'oh look, that's not Ah thing.
There's no rhyme or reason to it.
And also Jack Frost is there.
But if Jack Frost is, there wouldn't be.
Would there be like a summer guy in a fall?
Where's womanizer?
Yeah, Exact.
Where's the whole wheat guy?
How do you not have Michael Myers?
He's a legendary Cratchit would be so great.
It's all these carrot cartoon sitting around and Michael wires.
Just with this finger is his hands folded at the end of the table, and he's the best behaved out of all of it, exactly.
Staring up the little pieces of Danish is that he can put through the hole.
No teens to murder anywhere near him or his family.
He can't get a gauge on how old these elves are.
Really, it's really frustrating.
He's always bringing his knife up and put it down, and we have to talk about the kids that were gonna deliver presents to.
So, yeah, it's a jack for us, one of these non entities, I guess just cause he's mentioned in a Christmas song and he's all upset because he doesn't have a holiday in Santa Claus does fart you get.
The weird thing is like the rules of this council don't make any sense because it's like I used to.
Tyler's like You have been accused of 25 counts of up staging center Klaus.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, like he's been going around like they say and like, you know what I need to cut two.
There's the cutouts in a mall or something with you gotta cut away to these examples because I used to.
Tyler's like, Yeah, you've been putting out Santa Claus cutouts and replacing them with Jack Frost cutouts or whatever, like wait.
So mall cop culture like like what's going on in F y e matters in this council.
Also in 2006 malls aren't what they used to be.
Who gives a shit what piece of cardboard you're taking down there.
Mostly gone by then.
And also he's been, like, freezing bulky nose and, like, you know, all this other shit.
Yeah, that's that's what you lead with your freezing volcano is my God.
Yeah.
Forget the cardboard cutouts of Santa Jesus.
So, yeah, they're like you're going to be, I guess.
What?
Stripped of your powers.
Some, then.
I mean, it's all very vague.
And this is a concept that is sort of brushed over in The last movie is like the tooth fairy helps him out for some reason.
So it's like, Oh, that's fun.
And then they like, kind of expanding this movie.
But it is doing in that 2nd 1 doing, Isn't that really?
Yeah.
Oh, and the funny thing is, this The sand man likes to fall asleep.
That is all there.
Doesn't he make you go to sleep?
Why would he notice?
Because he loves his work.
I holds water.
So they're like All right, I guess, to Martin shorts like, All right, I don't want to be a bad dude.
I want to help out Busy old Santa, because he's like, cynical is just complaining in this meeting at in lies Come back What are you talking about?
Saving Santa.
Just bitching through this whole first act, By the way, they sell them on this idea that it's Oh, he's a toymaker in Canada.
So him and his own, that's what they tell the in laws, right?
Eso then him and his arms have to, like, transformed the North Pole into being Canada.
And that's funny.
That is funny.
Joke also like roof eases in love.
Well, so that so.
It's like, All right, Santa has to go to Earth to pick up the in laws on and his ex family s o Martin.
Short as Jack Frost is going to stay behind in the North Pole And how elves need to be watched.
Yeah, every fucking second prisoners.
What's going on?
Oh, yeah, that's what you gotta watch him do.
They might scurry off also after after that, we're gonna get out of the basement in all these sales.
Oh, so, uh, picture those kid elves doing the spider walk from The Exorcist.
Do you need anymore help Santa Better movie, man.
I was going to say something, but I can't get the image out of so disturbing, is it?
Is it rose.
What were you saying?
Cabins.
So the meeting ends with Jack Frost like, please give me another chance.
Please give me another chance.
Right yet.
Let me be on Santa Clauses team.
Let me help out with the holidays.
And you know what this is?
This is, like, fucking every American government thing ever.
Don't leave a regulator.
Yes, they just needed a guy there to look over his shoulder.
Make sure he wasn't fucking things up.
That should be Spencer Breslin, though, or the recently deceased David Graham holds his character or no, you know, your audience.
Just make Michael Dorn the guy who has to watch him the whole time.
But then how are they gonna put the in laws to sleep?
Because these two thes two in laws will prattle to the world that there is some in law's Santy Claus festival.
Your ex family, like everyone in there, this little girl, like knows about him anyway.
So who cares that?
Well, that's but that's how dumbness is to give its on Lee because they talk to people in their town.
Yeah, that's the thing.
And Margaret Alan Arkin loved a gap.
Oh, you know what They love Facebook, I bet.
Oh, you might not have been my might not have gripped the senior community yet, as it has today.
Oh, yeah, but that's it.
That's the force.
Early senior adopters.
Yeah, I think so.
Um, so it's like, All right, go to earth with sand, man.
He's gonna help you knock him out.
Uh, sure.
Okay.
So they concoct this whole thing where he shows up in their driveway with Michael Doran.
And he's like, uh, yeah, Alan Arkin.
This this guy behind me is my driver.
We're gonna go to the airport now.
What?
Yeah, that's what he says.
My chauffeur.
Stupid, is it?
It's really stupid to supernatural beings that go across the world all the time.
I mean, bend time and space.
Conceivably.
Michel Dorn is everywhere all at once, because with the population, which is out of control bythe, that's a big problem.
Either thin the herd.
But there's someone going to sleep at every second.
Yeah, So where's door?
Where is George?
Hashtag We want war.
That's me, By the way, I think Joseph Gordon Levitt walked out of that sand man movie.
What if What if Michael Dorn er prizes the role he plays.
Morpheus.
I love the endless.
I don't think Michael Dorn could be e mo enough to tear.
That would just be really something.
That's an awful lot of face paint I have to wear.
Grab me my helm.
A drama taken to drop in case everyone likes to stir the pot on the Internet.
They're like, Oh, you were talking about Chris Jericho.
I'm gonna at Chris Jericho.
Don't at Michael Dorn.
We like Michael Door.
Yeah, totally.
And I don't care about Chris Jared.
I'm sure he's a great guy.
It doesn't mean I have to give a shit.
I don't want Internet feud with wrestlers or ex Star Trek.
People know that he's a current wrestler.
That's why we're eaten pounds a shit because he's still rasa ll.
You just explicitly asked all of them to ask Michael Dorn about.
I don't want that.
Michael Dorn is great.
I was literally just watching Star Trek.
The next generation let him sleep.
So Michael Dorn, as the Sandman, knocks them both out.
It's really uncomfortable because they're just like how many times he's done this toe like, you know, honest people that aren't trying to go to bed.
Yeah, man, I really wish I could stay up on.
I just passed out last night.
I don't know why.
Because he got a visit from the sand man.
Suddenly you're nude.
00 Michael Dorn's not pulling any of that.
Back up with your shirt off, and you're like, I guess it was hot last.
What?
We must have woken up and took that off New hashtag we want Worf.
Before you went to sleep, I might want my hashtag that tonight it comes true.
That's the case you unwrap my Chris with here.
That would not be in that situation is good looking older man.
It's not drama, but it'll d'oh!
So that he goes to his ex wife's house to see his son who's a grown boy who doesn't want to be in these movies anymore.
After he drags the coma, toast bodies in laws into his fucking sack.
Yeah, You gotta put those in the sack.
That?
Yeah, right in.
There s So he's like, hey, ex wife.
Where is that son?
And he's like, Oh, hey, movie.
I'm going to go snowboarding through most of that.
You think he aged out of being cute.
They're like, Yeah, get out of here.
We're gonna get a new cute kid.
He got replaced by this little redheaded girl, Billy.
Movies daughter, by the way.
Ah, about that.
Yeah.
Lost in space, Chris.
And one of the best episodes of the Twilight Zone.
So and she's like, Oh, wow, I can't wait to go to the North.
She could be calling him Uncle Scott.
And every time she calls me Uncle Scott Oh, no, no, no.
I just got divorced from your mom.
It's addictive.
Totally fine.
But that's just my divorce from your mom.
That's how involved he is with their lives.
So he is indeed, Uncle Scott, That is Judge Reinhold Skid.
Yeah, yeah, eso It is nothing to do with me.
Oh, nothing to do with you.
Could be.
It's a lot like, you know, some Your family friend is quote unquote uncle.
Sure, I guess that's where it falls on.
This is gonna sound really bad, but you give her about the same attention as a dog like that.
Don't take this the wrong way, But you treat this little girl like good friendly dog in the house like hey, Lucy.
How are you doing it?
And that's it.
I kind of agree.
I'm there to see my son.
I don't know you.
I didn't make you.
There should be like a supernatural council of uncle's way.
Good band, Uncle Rob compete.
They're all weighing in and they're all saying the same thing.
Treat her like a dog.
So saith us and chug it.
By the way, did you block us collectively on Facebook?
So then it turns into this thing where, like, he's trying to take his son to the North Pole.
But he's got a snowboarding date with people we've I've never seen.
So then it's like, Well, the three of us can go and he's like, Okay, does not want them there at all.
The street work.
He's trying to fucking work.
He's got a job to do.
Come in February, man, I'll show you the fucking operation that I'll give you a two day tour.
San has got nothing to do in February, but sit around, watch porn on the Internet, drink beer, bunch of meetings that's coming in February.
Good God, We're doing a podcast.
And also we've already established standards.
Fuckin four by seven loves.
Speaking of which, cause we mentioned this on previous Christmas episodes, There is a slight hint of we might be fucking on Christmas Christmas songs in this movie.
Which one?
There's some It's some like it were Ah ho ho.
Home guitar.
Fuckin Oh, I hate that.
So, whatever that piece of shit balloon is at the end of all that fucking like Santa Rock.
I don't need it.
It sucks even with Bruce Springsteen.
Just fucking shut it down.
I love the boss.
That fucking Santa Claus is coming to town.
I can't take it.
I love Bruce Springsteen.
I can't take that to mean that King Cole.
Give me some class on the holiday Charlie Brown.
Christmas Total already.
Just do it like you're not chugging beers on Christmas and you shouldn't be.
And I don't need fucking grandma got run over by a reindeer because I have a fucking shirt on.
All right, people Fuck too.
That's no.
I mean, they're hillbillies.
That song is about hillbillies.
Okay, so they don't They didn't have it was written by the It was written by the stars of the hills.
Have eyes, Theo, seventh member of Leonard Skinners he survived.
He crawled out of the wreckage to write.
Grandma got run over by radio.
Can I tell you, By the way, I've been drinking eggnog.
Sounds like before Thanksgiving.
Really?
Oh, I Jesus Christ, Did you just put a a big old, poor a bourbon in there?
It's right where you want to be.
That's got nothing to do with anything.
But all this talk about Grandma got run over there.
It's like it's like drinking ice cream.
You know, I I will say I don't appreciate this movie's Coco jokes all of the cocoa jokes and it's like a euphemism for alcohol.
You got too much cocoa.
It's that it's euphemism for coffee.
It's euphemism for blow.
It's a euphemism for, ah, party politics had Mrs Cocoa.
I mean, well, I mean Mrs Clause in the cocoa Oh God.
So he knocks his grandparent's out and that all the elves have to be.
And this has to be a little offensive to go up to all these elves and be like, Hey, you guys work like 36 hours a day and time passes differently in the North Pole.
But you're all little creepy, so you gotta wear these hats and yet make make your years a little bit more normal.
You know what I mean?
I don't want my and in laws to throw up wellit's like, you know, whenever spark traveled back in time.
Gotta put that fisherman's hat on.
My partner is obviously China.
Get some crazy lines.
I just watched that.
I just watched that one recently with a piece of the action.
No, no, no.
It's I think it's a city of the ISA tomorrow forever.
Yeah, it's one of the really.
It's on the edge of that girl getting hit by a truck.
Look, I asked Lawrence to take care of this, and clearly he couldn't.
But you all have to put Canada shit everywhere.
Nail it up to your doors, will take care of the labor forests, you know, just polished the shops up, but, you know, and I'm really sorry had to do this because Lauren says, and the guts to kill with guts, But yes, we're Canada now.
Eddie isn't thing.
How stupid do you think these people are like?
Listen, I've never been to France.
Yeah, I've never gone to Paris.
Right, But it's like if you brought me to the North Pole and some fake fucking place, and it's clearly just like a walking stereotype.
I'd be like, Was there something going on?
He It's offensive.
The signs.
Heart hockey?
Yeah, yeah, there's a hockey shop And of course, there's a big and tall hey, Canada.
You're fat belief thing.
Oh, it's every leaf, expresso or some I think there's a sign for universal health care.
I mean, Lucky Martin short that turncoats Canadian, just like sitting on saddling ifthis is cool.
Yeah, and everyone is doing a jokes like, you know, they'll be like, Hi, we're just We're not We're Canadian, We're not elves.
This isn't magic.
Hey, someone has the like elbow the person who's speaking and they go, Oh, a and then Alan Alda Arkin Class it up a little bit with Alan Alda in this fucking minute.
What if Alan Alda was the Elf's Forman?
You have to watch the whole movie.
I would have the foreman.
I would love it.
There's gonna be a lot of jokes about how tall is totally your luggage.
He's taller than everybody in this movie.
We're gonna work double shifts.
Santa Claus jokes about Korea I hope you like s Oh, yeah, they bring them all there And Elizabeth Mitchell's reunited with her parents.
But like immediately, immediately, this movie devolves into a John Kasich Betty's argument.
These people are fucking screaming and yelling anything.
You shut us out.
Holy Mother, What is that clear?
Man?
I don't need that.
I'm not on the holidays.
Oh, my God, it's insane.
They just start fighting.
And, like Tim Allen's tryingto work.
And there's this crazy thing where, like the the like, the star on the tree, the tree falls over and this thing shatters later.
That's the That's the What's going on is Martin shorts like, Oh, I'm gonna help out.
But to your Chris's point, there's no regulating body to watch, and he keeps fucking up Santa's workshop.
He is tempting the elves with Coco, which is weird because I mean, look, at best, it's just coffee.
Like you get all hopped up on goofballs.
They're a little kids, man.
You think you're a little kid.
Coffee, sugar, 900 years old man.
I mean, that's why this movie needs to specify what is going on.
Either you hire a bunch of kids and their kid elves or you get fucking a bunch of little Mickey Rooney's running around in those here.
L fucking little Yoda's or something.
Or how about a mix?
Why are they all children?
I get it.
It's like a kid's movie.
But David Krumholtz was like fucking 45 in that first movie.
Come on.
My question, though, is Is it Is it weird for the little people acting community?
Are we taken rolls away from them by casting?
Ah, Bob Newhart in that elf movie or are we not?
Is it is it okay?
They got to be tired of playing?
L.
I would think so for sure.
But then now then.
But that's my whole year.
That's my whole fiscal year.
Now we'll be working at a mall.
Yeah, that's true.
Or like Boardwalk Empire Boardwalk out fire be a boxer on Boardwalk Empire.
I mean, you know, thankfully, Peter Dinklage is fucking smashing all the ceilings playing X men villain and also just plain Bill Duke and movies.
You do anything catching up with the greats like Bill, do you think of jobs away from building?
That's the other question.
Is it okay to take rolls away from Bill Duke.
I think Bill Duke needs to be permanently employed.
He should be always on the silver screen.
Bill Duke should be on last man standing.
He might very well might be.
Might be the producer.
Um, so what?
Oh, yes.
So we're introduced to the concept.
We should just talk about this.
It's the subtitle of the Move.
The Escape Clause.
So the whole conceit of this is like, it's a way for Santa to not be Santa anymore with this time travel and crazy And like, it involves something called the Hall of Snow globes.
Fuck this.
They set up how to not be San anymore.
That's you get fucking murders.
That's it's a pine box.
Exactly like a supreme court.
Oh, you're not saying any more you want.
Uh, here's a new job.
It's called pushing up daisies.
That's what it should have been.
Cabin fucking Tim Allen gets Antonin Scalia in this movie.
You mean the CIA?
Do they fucking with enough now?
Yeah, that pillow.
Yeah, put it over his had the fucking chokes on feathers.
Dude, I'm the same Exume that body.
I don't care if the widow Scalia's crying.
You gotta get out of the way.
Bring that body up.
You bring that hateful fat body out of the girls were willing to pull guns.
Another conspiracy theories.
Dig up that you won't get a shovel, hillbilly.
No, it's just like you want the escape clause.
So he goes.
He has the escape clause, and then Robert De Niro gets a phone call, and he's like the How did he escape?
Cause going well, we had a problem, and, uh, he's gone.
Way had to let him go.
He kicks over the phone booth and that's the end of it.
That would be awesome.
And there wasn't nothing we could do it.
That's a lot of looking for you Just seen Tim Allen.
If I could get thrown into a pile of snow by Oh, that would be great.
But instead, like he's got to say, I wish I wasn't Santa ever something like I I wish I was never Santa Claus at all that already died and noble global time touching his personalized Santa snow glow.
What a magic spell that sentence.
So Martin short tricks him into saying this.
I mean, but that's the problem like this.
It takes an hour to get here because the power of a fucking 96 minute movie, by the way, because the movie should be the alternate reality we go into that, this should be like this should be the framing device.
Fuck the little kid.
It should be just like maybe 1 20 minutes of this and then like you, Really, Mr Destiny, for a long time total.
And then at the end, you fix it.
It's like a 20 minute sequence.
It's kind of the whole movie.
Yeah, that's what I was Totally.
I've never seen this before, and I was totally surprised at how fast it's wrapped up because, yeah, it's like you're back to the future twos or more traditionally, Christmas time.
You're It's a wonderful life.
Exactly.
We need to really live in this new reality.
But to be fair, when you start doing shit like that, keep in mind.
It's a wonderful life is like two hours and 10 minutes long.
Can you imagine?
Yeah, that's 130 minutes of the Santa Clause three.
The second one's an hour and 45 that shit was hard to get through.
Well, that robots up to so many really another 25 minutes.
On top of that, I'm really, really considering, you know, now I haven't seen that 2nd 1 Does the robot get handsy with people?
Causes it like an evil Santa is evil, but he's not.
He has no no junk as far as I could wear.
How do you know that he's got no junk?
Krumholtz didn't bother to engineer genitalia.
He's naked and they show him he's like a Ken doll for us.
From the back, you could see that can deliver their ass cheeks.
Oh, God on Is that Tim Allen doing that new video?
I I'm excreting seeming through my pores.
Hey, Santa, you ever want to see a Ken doll used The n word?
That's who we need is the foreman l've It's Joey Pan Total So G I needed whatsoever.
Road of Christmas unlocked.
All right, everybody, it's a great day.
Today.
I fired Laurence Meat Joey Pants, You scumbags, listen up.
Christmas is coming.
Christmas is coming fast.
Organized this quickly.
Oh, no.
And then a comet dies in a stable fire, and then Santa Claus goes up to Joey pants his house to see what's going on and they get to a fight over over it.
You know, cause And then he goes, Fuck you, Sandy.
You'd sausage by the fucking I think it's hit the head with a frying pan.
That's right.
That's exactly how he'd go at complete talk really quickly about the reindeer party being gremlins, it's discovered.
Noises they make are like the in gremlins to the one that's in the soup like the thin red line.
Yeah, I agree.
Is that Gremlin saying Gremlin?
No.
All right, I say such a super gremlin.
But it's you know what's shocking about these reindeer, though not voiced by Frank.
Well, I know I have a double, right?
I triple checked.
I checked it with twice.
I think he booked a cruise.
He booked a voice acting cruise, but yeah, it's in there and they're starting.
And he's like, Oh, easy, easy.
Calm it.
Lay off the alfalfa p you great.
This is a great movie.
E ate the original l phone.
Oh, hey, I looked it up after we were talking about it on the show a couple weeks back.
What's his face from in cold blood and lost away?
But Robert Blake He definitely was a little rascal.
Yeah, it was gross.
You know, you could be a He could be an hour.
Yeah.
Joey fancied Robert Blake.
Oh, men.
They would whip this workshop in the shade.
I could be an elf.
Mara Gallagher.
Oh, that's it.
Maybe you'll be father time.
Oh, he could fit father time.
Guys, if Robert Blake is the middle management type here, the Hellmouth makes more sense.
Yeah, if we're gonna do that way, we can go that way, right?
Like he comes up with this new strategy.
Like, gotta intimidate these people.
So he's like, Santa.
You gotta be.
So he makes Santa like a scary figures of the elves are in line, right?
Started happening around gargoyles on every corner.
You fine.
God, that's right.
Eso Yes.
So we go back in time.
12 years of each.
But he said it is so fucking stupid.
The one thing he can't do.
Oh, by the way, uh, Jack Frost.
Martin.
Short way you talk about a little bit.
He looks really weird.
In this movie, he looks like a Martin short robot.
He does grow a lot of makeup like everyone's me, but he freezes.
Judge Reinhold Ing Wen, Wendy Crewson.
Oh, right.
And then, like, he locks the little girl in a closet like they'll freeze the little girl to that witness.
You got a kid.
If it killed a family, gotta kill a whole fucking She's the one that's gonna mouth off the most You straight up killing these people like they are murdered.
Like you're frozen for hours.
You're fucking frozen bodies.
Did look like something that you could find a John Carpenter movie.
Those things bone charities pretty.
And then get in the closet with them.
Okay, Sit in this closet with your clearly dead parents.
Indeterminate amount of time eggs.
You have a merry Christmas.
The best.
Oh, big time She's killed people.
Yes.
You know what?
She hates the holiday.
Now she's, like, the only way she knows howto to feel good about life.
Is that shop people up and put him in her freezer?
Oh, wow.
That's right.
She learned learned behaviors be Pommard.
She would be the source material for Silent night.
Deadly night too Garbage.
It's perfect.
It would be great.
We also did we touch on red deer.
How that is how you get into the snow globe.
Oh, it's Red Bull, but red deer.
Oh, and it's just all the stupid things where you just show the brand colors and like That's it.
But a Red Bull.
Red deer, right?
Well, it's Canada.
They read out there.
That's all they drink.
And it's also fun to have little kids drink fucking taurine by the gallon writes him.
Alan, you piece of shit.
We should not be pedaling Red Bull.
The children.
No way!
There's vodka and the creepiest part.
Whoa!
Got stuck to the Sandman about that way, don't it?
The end Margaret scenes.
So like Oh, it's it's Martin Short like, Yeah, he's a maligned, legendary figure much like short.
I got to tell you, we just watched that hair spray live last night and he's playing the dad on.
He's good.
He's good in it.
Round the horn.
What we think about, sure, I think he's kind of good.
I love him.
He's a vessel like he's.
He will take the shape of whatever you need the movie, to be exact.
Clifford.
He's gonna be terrible.
It's a terrible No, Clifford is a great movie.
I honestly really enjoyed split in the room on that one.
But you know where it's unacceptable.
Here's a shape I don't like him taking Jiminy Glick know always just something I don't need.
I will denounce him right here, right now, right here.
Now I denounce it.
Also, I denounce.
I abandoned my child, were bad in my Glick's.
It's just I've always hated it.
I've always hated that Ehrlich needed to go to a special school, but I love the weight and an air advice.
Oh, he's so awesome.
That's awesome.
And I was speaking to doing coke, but, um, so it's him.
Lee is like trying to get Anne Margaret's attention.
She's like, What?
But you could sing a lot of songs, and she's like, Why, as a matter of fact, I can and he's like what you're doing chestnuts roasting on an open fire and you look okay and singing and she gets to Jack Frost nipping at your nose and, uh, and he's like, you sing it again and she doesn't get it.
I'm like, Do this guy's a pervert.
You gotta walk away, right?
Well, she doesn't know he's Jack Frost.
Oh, she's singing it, She's sick and she don't even know it.
And I need women missing.
Jack Frost nipping at your nose.
The woman on the bus, She's wearing sandals.
You don't even know it.
What, are you nipping state again?
What are you weeping?
Oh, good news.
Oh, never knows.
It's a disturbing scene.
But to your point, he tricked Santa Claus into saying, I wish I was never Santa Claus at all.
Which is the one sentence you should never say Santa Claus.
And he knows that Santa Claus knows that we got we do a little bit of back to the future, Part two.
And now we're watching the first movie again.
Which I could watch Tim Allen murder Santa Claus at least 15 times a day.
What?
What?
He took a gun and shot him.
Now he looks like Tim Allen thinks that he's a burglar and he's like, Hey, you on the rough and Santa Claus goes Earth and, like, slips and slides down the route could have dies.
Fatal one storey drop a really good point.
You know what?
But also building on that that should be Jack Frost's and game is to make him slip and die.
You just kill him just this guy's brains out, then put the coat on.
That's easiest way to do it.
None of this casting a spell horseshit.
But so then, like, uh, got guns at the North Pole, they should.
Candy cane shaped gun.
Yes, well, there's a war on Christmas.
They've got a lot of weaponry.
Gotta liberate them.
Them Starbucks cups, WMDs at Which can we just Can we say really quickly?
If you're getting upset about Starbucks Cups, you can't celebrate Christmas this year.
Cancel Christmas for yourself.
If you're getting upset about Starbucks cups, please, please.
How about yeah, who gives a shit?
That's That's a great question.
People with too much time on their drink Your coffee.
That's red.
It's Red Cup.
That's a Christmas color or whatever.
Go in your car and fucking put the radio on.
Listed all the Christmas music.
Everyone is being subjected to 24 bodies that I just don't.
I just don't get it like why?
Why Why Why?
Why can't we change the design of a cup?
Why does it have to be fucking What?
What?
What does it need to be?
Santa Claus?
Eight reindeer, Mrs Claus.
Oh, no, no, no.
all that has to have is the word Christ on it.
So if you want to go in the privacy of your own home, watch the Passion of the Christ and jerk off.
That's your business.
What you do, Easter, That's what it is.
All right, well aren't fine.
You met Santa Claus on Christmas Cup, but on Easter, you need to have a fucking crucified Christ on your coffee.
I want to see a fucking limp dead Jesus on the cross, and they have to die.
The coffee read the whole month on Ash.
Wednesday, every single cup has to get the mark.
Here's the thing.
You kind of bothering the back, you fucking little bug, right?
Why don't you just take bye bye?
A car pick up like a travel mug, You know, with, like, Jesus in the manger and a big, old, juicy crucifix on it, or whatever you want.
Bring that to Starbucks and have them fill it up for you.
And I'll tell you another thing.
Can we all leave?
The Starbucks employees are alone.
Let's stop tricking them into doing weird names on the cup.
Yeah, they're getting what?
They don't fucking care.
They don't and you think got them.
They don't fucking care.
And no one cares about you.
Except for those those people on Facebook you boots with your uncle.
I was actually dio e.
I was talking to a buddy of mine who works at a Starbucks, and he was saying that the CEO of Starbucks decreed, Who cares about those people that you don't have to do it?
Yeah, So we're going back in time and watching Santa Claus diet because, yeah, and then Jack Frost hits Santa Claus.
They both go back in time, which kind of doesn't make sense.
They get sucked back through the time he's holding him.
Classic time travel visit.
It is Bill and Ted's rules.
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.
And he hits.
Um, uh, he hit Santa Claus in the face before he It's Tim Allen in the face before you get the jacket.
And then he puts the jacket on.
And now he's Santa Claus, even though how does that work in the time stream?
If he's coming back, why is that?
That's the thing.
Why isn't there the past Tim Allen bucking around there is later in the movie.
He comes back, but I know.
But in that first, there should be two.
Tim Allen's My God, That's to Tim Allen's.
Do many also, and I'm just He's already the representation of some bullshit.
He's a Magister person anywhere.
Why?
What?
You really think it has to be immortal.
I think he turns into Scrooge.
Young doesn't understand.
Doesn't remember his own life.
Like, why wouldn't you?
If you're 12 years went undone and you what became someone else?
Memories.
Why wouldn't you have those memories?
Now he does have them, but he doesn't understand.
Like away.
Why are we working on Christmas?
We becomes the business.
He doesn't those.
Yes.
It's weird.
He comes.
Yeah, he wakes up 12 years later, and he's like the CEO of some toy company, I guess.
In the first movies.
Toy representative.
Yeah, but like, yeah, to Eric's point, like it doesn't make sense.
Like he doesn't have any.
E only has the old memories back to Santa Claus.
One and two in his brain.
Right?
Not the last 12 years is over, but Marty and Doc don't know what happened to them.
They gotta go.
They gotta go solve it.
It's a time line diverged here into an alternate 1985.
At this points, you're Santa Claus.
For 12 years, you murdered Santa.
That's another thing that's weird.
These two sequels Airway later than that first movie.
Oh, yeah, The first movies, Like in the nineties, isn't it?
Took 94 the clamshell VHS case.
Uh, but so he's like, Oh, I got to go see my The first thing I gotta do this to you, because my God, I gotta make sure that I still have some sort of friendly, congenial relationship.
Have to judge Reinhold.
I have to make fun of doctor.
He loves debasing Judge Reinhold in these movies.
Yeah, it's very disturbed.
I think Tim Allen hates Judge Reinhold really does yoga.
And he's a psychiatrist.
Like fun, out of value.
That isn't exactly help.
Fucking 12 truckers in Middle America.
Therefore, is proof Lou and Garbage take a last stand on this one.
Yes, the last man standing, Malin, David Mamet.
In that sense, you know what I would make fun of Judge Reinhold for in this movie, though?
Everything in that 1st 1 He's got that hot dog whistle.
That's always stupid.
Yeah, that's that That's pretty stupid.
She's playing the dating it, like, just shut the fuck up, will you?
So then hey goes there and like, she's pissed off the music.
But we're best friends.
And here's here's Did you guys catch this interesting detail, by the way, So this is must have missed it.
Interesting, you say, though it's It's so shitty because this is supposed to be like a bad timeline.
The all 1985 Sherry Stewart was never born.
That whole thing, right?
So this is a quote unquote bad world, right?
So in in the real timeline, she's like, whatever business ish woman, I'm sure some some stature in this movie when she opens the door in that scene where it's bad, Bad timeline.
She's dressed up as a waitress on like her hair's fucked up, and she's got a name tag on, and it's like, Look how fucking miserable this woman's life is.
She has to be a waitress.
Oh, man, That shit.
The actual butterfly effect.
She works at a diner.
She is fucking down in the dumps.
It actually kind of surprised that because the kid the it's Christmas, even the kids like going out with his friends.
Like, I'm kind of surprised he wasn't like a Gothic or like a gangster rapper or whatever.
Fucking Timbaland's nightmares are good gay?
Yeah, we're good.
Good, good gay.
Heaven forbid.
I'm going out with my boyfriend on Christmas Eve in.
Tim Allen puts his fucking head in a snowbank.
But it was no belts.
But then he's like, But where's Judge Reinhold on Lucy and the fuck do you care about my daughter?
Do you get at it also?
How this needs to be a thing where that girl doesn't exist?
Yes, that has to happen.
What are you talking about?
We got divorced after six months.
We never had.
Who's Lucy?
What are you talking about?
Like I was waiting for that tow hap.
It's like, No, you still in this world produced the same exact kid.
I don't think she's a baby angel.
Now, measure is this carriage.
Then Mike Pence jailed her observation.
We're gonna hook electrodes to this angel and see what shakes out that that dude is the bad guy in an e t movie.
Really?
Do.
That's how he lights the top of his Christmas tree hooks, a car battery up to a fucking aborted angel.
So he's like, 00 she's like, Oh, Judge Reinhold in Lussier at the North Pole Music Frost made the North Pole commercial.
He takes a commercial flight, I guess.
Does this go through some magic barrier?
What are we talking about it?
Santa Airlines?
Dude, I think Richard Branson started.
How do you get to the North Pole without magic?
Well, I think Here's the thing.
I think in the in the preferred timeline, there's some sort of spell that masks this North Pole.
Oh, I think Martin Short's done away with all its okay.
Come on in.
And the balls for Disney to get on a high horse about Mark.
You better believe it.
And we just stopped Disney's way.
We can't commercialize Christmas while we're commercializing.
Chris here is so fucking outrageous and should be called the Santa Clause three, the pot calling the kettle black secure selling Red Bull to children in this movie.
And then you're like, Oh, man, these this misers trying to turn a dollar.
But meanwhile, my coffee cup is not the right color.
Yes, heaven forbid this is what we're getting on a bit, but so he goes to the North Pole and oh my God, it's so commercial.
Have to buy a ticket to everything just like fuck it, Disney World.
Oh, it's great cause it's all these rotten families fighting with each other about gifts and whatnot.
It's the thing is a welcome to the real Chris, in case you were wondering.
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure, but like you don't see really any of the attractions.
It's just a gigantic gift shop.
Like the workshop is a gift.
Sure, and they're all these.
Like, be sure you stick around for the two o'clock reindeer execution, like whatever it is.
But you don't see any of that stuff like, I want to see those that all the elves have like the old, like the placards for, like tour bus tours and stuff like that.
Ask about our tree shine ings or whatever the hell it's those dudes on the street's spinning arrows that say this way to subway but s so he's like, Oh my God, it's a fucking nightmare, right?
And like, hey runs into Judge Reinhold.
Also the balls on it just goes to Judge Reynolds like, why'd you get divorced from my wife.
I'll tell you why, Tim Allen.
Because your son never warmed up to me.
And therefore we had Ah, lot of problems in our marriage.
And I'm like, Hey, guess what, dude?
Not my problem.
I've been divorced for years by totally fixed your marriage.
How is that Tim Allen's fall?
I blame you.
I never thought I'd be saying this, but it's not Tim Allen's fall.
Well, that's this shitty think.
It's because he has been jumping on this character.
The step Dad has been dumped on for three movies.
Now so and now you're suggesting that the only thing that was keeping that family together it was fucking Tim Allen's mouth?
You've got to be kidding me, guys.
So he's like by Tim Allen Bye forever.
He's dressed like his character, and vice versa is Oh, do you think that that's actually Fred Savage and the little girl is Judge Reinhold Way also got vice verse it, so I'm trying to figure that out first, and then I'll figure out your your supplementary timeline.
And somehow the little girl has a really thick Chicago accent.
So he goes the little girl, and he's like Hey.
And she's like, I don't know what the fuck you are, man.
For high by friends as we should.
Yeah, she's like you normally treat me like I'm a friendly dog.
Mr Calvin.
She calls him.
Aren't you gonna put a cookie in my mouth and walk over?
But he like robes.
Is LeGros okay?
I know you like snow globes, and she's like, I guess I do.
And he's like, you go to that special room and get me this.
No globe, you'll save pressures.
Your heist movie.
Yeah, that's true.
Also, right away, a mountain snow globes.
Do me a favor.
My my ex wife's ex husband.
Don't whisper to my daughter.
Do me that one favor.
Don't ever have a secret with my daughter.
Thanks.
And what?
Whoa!
That's a lifetime movie titles.
I don't have a secret of my daughter.
Um, don't have a secret of my daughter to you had a secret with my daughter on.
Also on the subject of keeping secrets, Martin short locked that fucking snow globe room.
Yes, or demolish it.
Put it somewhere else.
Break that shit up.
Cask of amontillado style.
Oh, and Tim Allen goes up to Martin short is that you tricked me and there's it's it's a ill set up.
Ah, microphone pen, which I need, because at the end, he used him like that was a microphone.
No, it's dude.
It's quite literally.
The exact opposite of ill set up it's about is set up is you can get you know how I know because I noticed it and I never notice stuff like that.
He's like he's trying to sell Tim Allen on this pen.
He's like, pick up a pen.
They record things and he records himself in, plays it back, and Tim Allen's like that stupid, and he takes it from him.
And then he totally plays the think like, you see, Tim Allen lifts this thing up and clicks it, and he's like, What is that thing you made me say?
And he says it and he's like, Thank you.
I really it's It's so ridiculously set up, and I was like, Oh, so that's how you're going to solve this?
What?
I didn't guess what was gonna happen is that happens approximately four and 1/2 minutes.
It's just we're so rapidly solving this problem.
It's outrageous.
Well, I mean, you do need a Martin short musical number to fill those four and 1/2 minutes.
Now, I'll admit this is where I started falling asleep.
Okay?
I I got caught up watching that three hour hairspray live less.
And the last thing you want to do is watch Martin short.
Sing it one more sec.
Although, I'll tell you what him and Harvey Firestein together was fucking right on.
All right?
But by the time this scene rolled around on movie, I was falling asleep.
So what song is he saying?
Is it a real song or fakes on North Pole?
North Pole?
Yes.
00 that's right.
Oh, it just came flooding back.
Oh, God did it ever.
It's awful.
It's defending your life when that I'm not defending your life in the notice.
Uh, the one where Albert Brooks dies is defending.
You know, it's like Lost in America, where that guy's tried to tell him how to sing a jingle about Ford.
He's like, It's It's Ford.
So what is the purpose of singing that song?
Is he selling some?
That's that's the show.
It's like like you like if you're going to Vegas, you know TOC Jack Frost.
Sing a stupid fucking song.
He's only a little dough here than he is of the body horror, I guess, because he's an immortal didn't get him so much.
And also he looks exactly Wolf Blitzer, by the way.
Totally stupid white frost hair.
It's like you're Blitzer with, like, steely blue eyes.
It's I'm shuttering right now thinking about it.
But then yet four and 1/2 minutes later, the little girl like, throws the ball and he's like a catch, and then he clicks it, and then we go back through right?
Yeah, we go back, we go back through it.
It's the two of them, and then we do see 94 Tim Allen.
And so it's a much thinner and darker haired Timbaland and less plastic surgery.
And you see, the weird thing is like I remember I haven't seen the 1st 1 in a while.
Like it's kind of a good gag.
The guy falls and the little kids like you killed him.
It's like kind of that's an edgy ish job was the nineties.
We could still have that first movie, despite its faults, was a movie.
This is not A.
It's not a question.
Was this theatrically released?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, Laura are in the year of our Lord.
19.
92,006.
And then they started planning the Tooth Fairy franchise from, But Art LeFlore was never seen again.
But the weird thing is that let's talk about the time twist year.
So then, basically, Ah, in this timeline, Tim Allen holds on to Jack Frost so he can't get the coat and the right Tim Allen.
The younger Tim Allen, right, goes and grabs it, setting the timeline back.
But like this weird thing like and then he remembers it.
And then, like, they should know.
Frost, I don't remember anything.
Just gets a raise.
You know, it should be a loop, actually, because it would never end because basically, every time then Steve, you know what?
Sure, whatever.
Sure, every single time line.
Also, these people have to live out their lives.
Yeah, so she's a waitress and she eventually dies.
Sure rots, and eventually the world ends and restarts itself.
She's just in that timeline, but there's other people.
In other times, he goes up there with the baby angel heads, tortures.
They should all be like when they go back to the regular timeline.
Everybody should have massive nose bleeds.
You're fussing too much with the space time continuum.
It's raining donuts.
I've been watching that.
I watched some of that Simpsons Marathon brain.
Who does?
What's a doughnut look, it's raining.
Um, yes.
And then he just comes back.
And he's like, Hey, Elizabeth Mitchell.
Sorry, I've been being a dick.
I love being Santa, and I love being your husband.
Let's have this baby and I am against the purge.
Actually, I've learned the Burgess wrong, but they lend Ah, basically like Christmas gets saved for some reason, because then all the magic who's a fudge is come out helping at the workshop because the elves get their fucking ass in gear.
Finally, but she's having this baby when you actually have to get the Jack Frost thing.
End of Jack.
It's disgusting.
So, like, they're like the time line's been fixed in Santa Claus is happy and, like Theo's are back at work, and this little girl comes out like my parents.
Thes two little like mummies are terrifying.
Dude, the only way this movie should end is fucking Santa Claus and art LeFlore Big old gruff, our love for grab and Jack Frost and shoved him down into the electric chair.
E was shamed him in a chain.
And, man, I thought you were gonna say just each take a limb and pull a wishbone like or like when the classic execution.
And it sucks that we don't do this anymore.
Well, you take a guy, the two horses.
Oh, yeah.
Horses guy.
I'd say you know what?
Get you.
Haven't have we done it with four horses or four reindeer?
Well, they didn't in the in the picture with the two cars.
Oh, that's a moderate.
Its horsepower afford a Wilson.
I'm going to kill my enemy.
Come on, Al.
Just time to the bumper.
Did I?
The series finale of Home Improvement should have been Al Borland.
Fucking Talyn.
That guy off.
Hey, Tim the tool man.
Taylor, Here's what I think of you.
Maybe it's like you.
What sucks about that?
Shows that tried to go dramatic too much and they could go either way with this.
Al brings a gun to work.
The last episode Binford starts making guns.
Oh, that's exactly Oh, that'd be awesome.
Actually, Al Borland murders the whole studio audience with a nail gun.
E or no, Held tonight.
Know Tim's like our our superpower.
Distinct.
Hey, Alex, use it in the Al dies and Tim Esther with the law at long last.
That's a dangerous thing, man.
You're fucking on power tools.
He realizes that Al Borland was his one and only true friend because much like Roseanne, that show had a lot of like buddies of his.
But nobody that really stuck around.
No, they're all at the sports bar.
And just like peanuts next to him were coming over for cards.
And the tool man sounds etcetera, cold pizzas.
Yeah.
So, uh, these two people are frozen, and there's a weird thing in the middle of the movie where he's like, Well, Lucy, your hugs or magic and she's like, Yeah, sure.
That's weird to say to me.
I gave her that snow globe.
Yeah, And then, like, he's like, Well, there's only And like, no one can unfreeze these people in the Jack Frost.
Even like I can't Unless I'm unfrozen.
I can unfreeze him, which doesn't make anything.
So she hugs him and it turns him into, like a sunny guy like you turn him into Clifford does.
He has a clever haircut.
I gotta mention like it's very unsettling.
I forgot about this, but the Santa gives her towards the start of the film.
I believe Snow Globe, Uh, wherein there's a miniature version of her that's like It's just it's the actress playing this moment and it's her hugging some goddamn thing.
A snowman snowman.
Oh, so she's killing a snowman.
She's killing a snowmen, and it's like this, but it's like it's like she was shrunk.
Yes, it premiered and Weights of the Magic.
But she has the magic powers that this I think we should get inaugurated into the council after this.
I think so, Yeah, she's the heat miser, man.
I think she's the creepy little girl.
That's the Halloween figure.
Actually, now that I think about when he turns in when he's not Jack Frost, he's just regular frost.
I don't know Jack, Jack, Jack.
He kind of looks like David Miscavige.
He does actually look very much like I would have preferred the ally chair or the ripping apart.
That's probably what you want, but it warms his heart and then it melts thes people.
And that's kind.
And let me tell you about the melting for a hot second.
This is some of the cheapest shit.
Oh, sure.
Oh my God, How?
Like, listen, Disney.
Last time I checked your Disney, let's put some special effects into this.
It's like this, this superimposed like white mask.
It looks like when the Three Stooges would get hit with cream pie.
It's this disgusting thing and Judge Reinhold in the other woman like leap out of it.
It's like, terribly animated.
I mean, my God, Maybe that mask stays on Judge Reinhold, and he becomes the Myers boy shaped judge.
Reinhold is the judge.
Reinhold could play a serial killer, have something.
Let's figure that he's still he's still around.
The end of this movie is my least favorite kind of credit sequence, which is the gag reel and its honor.
And it's so hard because I didn't laugh once.
I I don't like gag reels at all.
I don't like girls either, then Oh my God.
And you're just like, Oh, hey, you know all those jokes that weren't funny?
What if they didn't land well, The best part of the gag reel.
It's the Sea and its assuming He's in the door with Wendy Crewson and like he's supposed to be saying like Frost, turn the North Pole into a theme park.
But Wendy Crewson can't keep it together because it's so funny to be around Tim Allen.
And like he's he snaps center in this guy in the middle of a game Really just goes.
Is there something?
Is there something amusing about the way I'm acting right now and like Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, That's real.
Tim Allen to go back to the trailers.
Nancy Travis has heard that line.
A few fucking everybody had to cool off.
We kind of lost the threat of Alan Arkin.
And on the and harder Yeah Ah, they find out that he's Santa Claus here of e comes out sound.
Wait, Did what that movie Recall it.
We've got to cut that out.
Alan Arkin is like losing his mind about how afraid it is that he's related to Santa Claus.
This old Jewish man cares about to disavow this whole family.
Yet that John Kasich Betty's Fizi, he's been shut out for like, a decade like Oh, great on my kids.
Santa Claus Testing There's this whole thing with these is like I'm father and locks Christmas.
Yeah.
Say, saying this is Canada.
Are you sure?
Isn't called Waco.
Oh, man, Santa Claus lives at the Branch Davidian.
Come on, man.
And Alan Arkin like he's got it.
He's like, I got to get out of here.
I got to get out of here, Donna, I'm going to start a small fire s O that theeighty f knows to come in and help us.
It'll be No, it's gonna be controlled.
I'm gonna be right here with the fire extinguisher.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
It's good.
I didn't know that these elves were making flammable toys.
And you gotta trust the government.
You've got to trust them.
They're gonna come in.
They're gonna They're gonna get us.
Don't worry.
Who knew?
Senate?
All these oily rags.
Oh!
Oh, thank God.
It's you, Officer.
Come, Help!
Help!
Oh, now you're shooting at us.
I got holes in my body.
What's this?
Bleeding to death over here?
That would be a much better ending the Santa Claus to talk about the escape.
Climb on and hum.
L went off so This is blood.
This is my blood.
Oh, dead.
I'm dying.
This I would all like much more than buddy, cause oh, man, the baby's name is body named after Alan Arkin.
For some reason.
Eyes the North Pole in relation to the fortress of solitude.
Are we talking like, next to each other?
We're same postal code.
Okay.
I thought you had the like, like, move through a portal to get into the the solitude.
Yeah, but they still get mail.
Makes up?
Yeah, sure.
Walked.
You walked to a diner afterwards?
I mean, Bermuda Triangle is also getting a lot of letters that are going.
They're the loveliest of all the mystical places.
Amelia, She's dropping off the mail.
I'm bleeding to death.
I'm blue.
Where's Superman?
I thought Superman would be here.
Well, no, actually, he gave up his powers to fuck for a little while.
That happens every so often.
That's right.
That's right.
My blood.
Not enough.
Michael Dorn in this movie, not nearly have really stupid side carriage.
I think it should be about the council.
It's a kind of a bad concept, but like what?
It's a concert.
It's a concept you have all these like B list celebrities and, you know, by the public just speaking to B list and those outtakes.
And I just realized my most uncomfortable one.
Is this fucking dude?
Goddamn Eddie Lebec.
Playing the Easter Bunny is like saying grow shit.
And Marty really uncomfortable with all these children and she fucking goes like she breaks the take and she goes, Dude, you're creeping me out or something like that.

Probably Toy story three.

That was a long one, But I'm talking Stories came Alan.
It's like, Yeah, that's where you just gotta watch this ass hole on the screen.
Uh, no one's recommending this.
No, the 1st 1 is bad, but the 1st 1 at least doesn't have a diastolic.
Uh, I mean, I guess, like, if you're you might have nostalgia towards this movie, but, like, it's really wretched.
If you're 15 years old, you watch this when it came out when you were a kid.
Yeah, it's just it's not very good.
No, it sank his franchise.
There's no Santa Claus for God for that.
Thank God for that, Indeed.

Hey, this was a question I asked myself while we were chatting this evening.
Who is better or should I say whose movies would you rather watch?
Maur of Tim Allen or Larry the Cable guy?
Tim Allen.
Who?
I go, Larry?
No.
Are we excluding toy stories?
Yeah.
Like so Tim Allen movies.
And not like Larry the cable guy in those shitty cards.
Okay.
Think of many Tim Allen.

I believe there was Was Was there something else?
A little something that got canceled.
Baby was on the shark for an episode of the show.
The James With You, I'm saying, Larry, I'm saying Larry, kind of almost.
No, I mean, Tim Allen's a better actor.
You have to get it.
Yeah, he's He's like a regular person.
Larry's a cartoon character, so maybe his antics are more pleasing on screen.
I could.
This'd is This is a tough decision.
I know, man.
It's really hard.
I think I'm going Larry, right?
I think it's Larry tried every thought.
I defend him Alan in a room full of my friends, But I bet Larry the way we haven't had a good hash going for a while.
You know, this is split in the room right now.
Yeah.
Tweet team.
Larry or Tash?
Tag team.
Tim.
Yeah, and we'll see what happens out there.
And Twitter land.
I'm really curious about this because here's here's I guess my to focal points.
I would rather watch Jingle all the way to again.
Then Santa Claus.
Three.
The Escape Clause Again, I agree.
But I would rather watch Santa Claus one or even Santa Claus, too, with Fascist Santa Claus.
I would rather want All right, Santa Claus.
Oi!
I'd rather watch a Tim Allen movie than witless protection.
Yeah, I been helping Red Belt.
That's something that's a movie.
Don't get to count in the movies.
You think this name of fucking movie that a good movie that Larry the cable guy is in for three scenes?
Wait, Larry the cable guys in Red Bow No Tim Allen, Alice and Red Belt for like, three Seed is playing Tim Allen, though.
No thes manager something.
So I don't know if it was like they went to a fight and Tim Allen was there gambling.
I think there was Oscar buzz for Tim Allen for that movie.
That buzz not really buzz.
Maybe that's but one guy on the corner of your street said that No, I'm sorry that Zachary Steve Goto work.
Tim Allen's got some Oscar buzz with that.
That was really good.
I bought Coast good movie Steve.
I bought Coke from Zachary Ty Bryan said that it is really good in Red Belt, His greatest performances when he gets hit in the cock with a harpoon gun and carry too well, that's pretty.
Is he also the one who was in that future?
Lawyers show that we never been ableto deals.
You know, we're getting off track.
It's team Larrier team.
Tim and I just remembered the greatest Tim Allen performance of all time.
Where he's playing.
Tim Allen is there, isn't it?
With some like news interview.
It was after one of those famous, like Mike Tyson knock somebody out in 15 seconds.
Kind of a thing.
Sure, and he's coming out of the, like MGM Grand Ballroom or whatever that shit is on there.
Like, Hey, Tim Allen, what do you think in a fight?
And he was clearly, like, lost money.
And he was so pissed.
He just goes, What fight walked away from the Nice.

So what Steve is describing is him spitting on everyone spit on everyone in the front row with a whole mouthful of water on a nice couple that were just sitting there having a nice eye on people for the holiday from every time Mark they got 1/3 the splash.
