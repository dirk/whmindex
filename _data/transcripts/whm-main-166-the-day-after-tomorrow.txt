Hello, Mandra, Jupiter, Stephen said.
Eric Cisco.
And we hate movies.
Way wait.
Movies.
Thank you for tuning in to our fine program.
If you are new to the podcast, you're catching us the tail end of our summer blockbuster extravaganza.
It's not quite done yet.
We got a few more episodes ago.
This is the third toe last, uh, of what we've been calling on Twitter hashtag SB 2014 which I've seen a lot of people are using.
That's fantastic.
Keep it up.
This week we're talking about another Roland Emmerich film.
This time it's 2000 four's The Day After Tomorrow.
Man, this movie is on the highest of horses.
I can't even see this movie's head.
This horse is so high.
Oh, yeah, this movie things that every word that it says has been like written in blood on a fucking holy stone somewhere.
And the problem is, it's not a trashy disaster movie, and it really, really should be.
Well, you know why It's that goddamn lib tard message.
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna you know, I'm trying not to get political on the show.
Oh, my God.
It is just jamming it down.
Your throat, and it's like it's one of those things where I'm like, you know, sometimes it's okay to jam stuff down someone's throat, But in this instance, it's like, What do you What are you accomplishing with this movie?
Like, Yes, global warming is a huge problem.
It's become way more of a problem.
In the 10 years since this fucking movie, this movie is basically come to fruition.
Yeah, way have polar vortexes Now I had to travel against the wolves.
On my way here.
I see that people want T G I wolves.
Yeah, it's a computer.
Wolves everywhere.
Now it's an epidemic in the city.
10 years later, computer world.
Yeah, And for a movie that's like building itself is this big disaster movie.
Ah, Fucking don't know.
Like 1/3 of it is people hiding in a library.
Well, the 1st 45 minutes is an okay movie called The Day After Tomorrow and then the last hour and 15 minutes is my dad's coming to pick me up.
Guys, guys, my dad's coming to pick me up, huh?
And like, because his dad's coming to pick him up, He Jake Gyllenhaal is just checked out of the movie like he's just He's waiting for a ride.
You have a character this waiting for a rise in the foyer with his bag and his coat.
And like Jake, your dad, he's not coming for a while.
You want to come hang out with the rest of it?
No.
My dad's gonna pick us up.
I'm here.
I'm ready.
Yeah, and he's calling his dad from pay phones.
Well, that's something you don't see any more.
It's true.
They're long gone.
I don't think you would find one in the public library these days.
What is he, a mish?
Martha, I'm gonna touch this this evil devil box.
But I have to, because the world is ending.
I know the Amish have to, like, stay true, But, like, wouldn't it be cool if they were like, all right, guys knew Amish.
We're taking everything back to 1960.
It would still be spurning a lot of technological advancement right below the civil rights movement.
Where you wanna be keeping it?
Where the Amish in like it?
That's a ce faras.
I'll go English.
I'm gonna get a lot of bad Amish e mails now.
If they do they are better.
If you're writing me an email Amish person, shame on you.
Would have stole your soul.
Well, if they are writing us, they might be part of this.
Hamish.
Matthew.
Oh, yeah, That show.
Yeah.
Are they killing people like, is it a serious mafia?
Or were killing chickens or something that I don't have no idea.
Like the Italian Mafia.
It's like I'm well, I'm gonna paint his barn really shitty.
I dare you to go down.
Coat day to get out of Arthur Avenue would put some fucking strawberry ice cream in somebody's face to see what happens to you.
That a Bronx Bronx Arthur Avenue is a location in Bronx, New York, where the Mafia comes to play.
Also some good.
Definitely.
It's retailers and a wonderful restaurant.
So this movie man is about, like, the whole weather structure of the world changes, and it really, really jams down your throat because the 20th century Fox logo Yeah.
Oh, it's stormy.
Oh, it's going to start my fucking I despise when movies open and they like the production company or the film distributor will change the look of their logo to make it go lick in theme with the movie.
Oh, forget it.
It's done with that.
Now I feel like we've passed it.
Had a today.
I'm concerned that as recently as the new X Men movie, something happened to that fox logo.
I'm fucking with it.
I'm not 100%.
And I think it's mostly Fox.
I feel like the, um the the shitty Sony, the Sony Lady.
Ah has changed a little bit here and there, I think Universal, maybe here in there, uh, Warner Brothers is a big offenders.
Well, it's Fox Warner Brothers like the Russia of the Soviet Union in the U.
S.
Because if it's like, you know, it's a movie about this is what I don't understand, though, because this is the perfect time to do it.
Like, here's this movie.
We're like a new ice age comes to the planet, right?
They could have that little cartoon squirrel.
Scrat could have come in.
It's owned by Fox Scrap.
Could have been their energy, but oh, no.
But like, uh, why doesn't it freeze?
Yeah, Why?
They're just dumb clouds.
If you're gonna want to give away the third act.
Oh, come on.
That's in the preview that the Ice Age is coming.
You hear handsome Dennis Quaid say Ice age four times in the preview man, Dennis Quaid in this movie that that face is worse for wear a za movie goes on.
Yeah, he gets a little Harang because the sun's you know, on the other side of the country and he's gonna walk from Jersey Thio Manhattan to deal with it.
Well, speaking of walking in the beginning of this movie, he's doing some sweet, super Mario jumps which don't make a whole lot of sense.
Why is he a super jumper?
Oh, yeah, because they're like, Were were there in some cold spot on Antarctica.
Yes.
And the young and inexperienced guy Dash Me Hawk.
Yeah, who's that?
He is that like a bounty hunter and star horse, it sounds like now he is, uh, I feel like he's played a doofus and think he's leaves a doofus and a lot of things.
He's the guy and Punisher War Zone, the the dumb cop.
Oh yeah, that's where I think I recognize he's in Romeo.
Plus, Juliette equals equals a movie.
I've seen two ready time, but so he's in there they're doing like some some Antarctic like weather research or some such nonsense.
And, uh, you know, there's a big crack that he's like drilling and there's a big crack that happens because, like a big part of the ice shelf is breaking off into the ocean.
And it's just like going down and like, he almost falls.
And then, like they save him.
And then oh, but the equipment and Dennis Quaid's like jumping over this ravine back and forth with this year, there's a loo.
Easy job for his legs.
Kind of spin a lot.
Forget to get a science stuff.
This is Oh, my, my science posters or whatever.
Oh, my Al Einstein both.
It's Einstein with his tongue out, it's It's John Belushi in college.
That's My X Files.
I want to believe Poster.
It's the big wall sized one of Bob Marley's smoking a huge split.
Oh fuck.
Do we got to go back to college?
Would be great.
Really.
I saw a poster I always despised that I despised and admired the dude on our campus that would always be selling posters outside the bookstore exit was like, you know what you're selling is garbage nude.
But God bless you for making off fucking fortune off of it.
Yeah, he would have, Like every cell of the original Boondocks Saints movie and, um, poster form.
Oh, yeah.
Zo like hotcakes.
That's where I got my adaptation poster.
Because why wouldn't you want to wake up every day?
Said, Look, look, looking at Nic Cage in a flowerpot?
Why wouldn't Why wouldn't you do that?
That's a movie.
You want everyone to know?
You like that?
Yeah.
That sounds like three or four years to me.
Hey, I watched legitimate cinema years.
Nicholas Cage with curly hair.
Yeah, I like important movies.
Uh, yeah, I had the fear and Loathing poster.
It was a nice little conversation piece, because then you could tell people.
Hey, I also read the book.
And yes, it was 168 pages.
You're welcome.
So a lot of this movie is just Dennis Quaid trying to convince a Dick Cheney surrogate that, like, the world is ending, and this guy just does not want to hear it.
He's being a real prick.
Is that like the vaccine is?
You know, we're at the summit, and he's giving giving his findings about like Oh my God, it's really happening The day after tomorrow is coming.
What's amazing is during this lecture, it's at the U.
N.
And a lot of people are raising their hands and asking him questions as if this is the first ever lecture that's been given on the subject of climate change.
They're like, So you say it.
Wait, wait, wait.
So if I understand this right, the ozone layer is depleting and some more rays from the sun or getting in those heating up?
Well, this is a thing that's happening where we won't well, what's happening.
The s Who did that outdoors in the back?
Well, thanks for nothing, Professor.
With just like slabs the door.
Anybody saw my documentary that came out several years prior to this?
You'd already be informed, but thanks for wasting everybody's time.
Dennis Quaid, that Dick Cheney surrogate stole the election for May, and there would definitely it would be the day after the day after tomorrow.
If I was elected president, we would certainly have several less conservative Supreme Court judges.
That's true, certainly would and tactical.
Yeah, There you go.
And Jim Henson's favorite Senator Joe Lieberman would've been vice president, a man Jolie on and video games would be outlawed.
Lieberman Yeah, Lieberman outline video games.
That guy was a fucking a few fries short of a happy meal.
Hey, didn't exactly swing in this swing that Florida, that's for sure.
Nobody was coming out for Joe Lieberman.
What do you mean by that?
I really don't mean anything.
I just mean that he didn't.
He did not bring in the votes Erik that he's promised.
So Ah, few years removed from Donnie Darko.
Jake Gyllenhaal's in this movie.
It was astounding to me that he still looks like a little kids so much in this movie.
No, I was This is a 17 my ass kind of thing.
Like he looks.
I don't mean to say that he looks 17 but he looks a lot younger than he does.
Oh, yeah, now he's looking my he's a big man's got a beard down.
I gotta buy Mom a man.
That's my Jake tell you he's playing.
Ah, you know, uh, Dennis Quaid's son, Junk Bonds, which is, you know, it's the it's the classic hook thing, you know, like my word is my bond.
Yeah, right.
Junk bonds.
And you know, it's the same thing like you promised.
It's taking the airport.
He comes too late.
He's like dad, you know?
Oh, you know, you never come from, you know you would.
You know, even if the world was ending and I was in New York and you were in Washington, you wouldn't find a way to get to me if I was stuck in a library.
And you're doing weather conference with World started to end, You wouldn't fucking find me.
Looks like Dad.
He flunks math because he refuses to show his work and gets real indignant about it.
And I bought that.
Bothered me a lot because you were one of those people that was desperately trying to cling to any kind of passing math grades.
Yeah, or you'd be sitting next to someone like Jake General.
And we like, why would he show his work so complicated?
I want a copy it, but he's not this high horse like, Oh, you know, I got all the answers, right.
Man is smarter than the teacher, okay?
Dead and his death.
It won't.
Great son of no fucking Do you do the goddamn assignment.
Because Dennis Quaid is like, Oh, you're trying to tell me that he just he flunked you because you're smarter than he is.
And he's like, Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
He's like, Well, I'm gonna call the school, and he's just gonna take care of it.
It's like, You know what?
No.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
School.
My son is smarter than all of you.
So you give him an A?
Did I mention I predicted the end of the world, which is coming, by the way, You should also run for your lives.
But first, change that grave.
Well, yeah, Like I'm sorry they get off your high wars of the teacher says you have to show your work.
Show your work.
I'm not impressed that you could just write stuff down.
Exactly, because also, who knows?
Maybe you got a copy of the test and you copied, You know, you memorize all the answers or something.
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm just a schoolteacher.
I got a ton of shit to do.
You show your work, kid.
Fucking arrogant asshole of this movie.
So he's going to have a academic decathlon in New York.
Yes.
And he's going with me.
Ross, Um, shameless is Emmie Ross.
Um, and some other kid nobody ever saw again.
I was going to say The Phantom of the Operas M E Rossa.
Oh, yeah.
There you go.
I think that might have been the only thing I've seen her.
I was gonna say nothing's, uh, Mystic River's Emmie Ross.
Oh, that's right.
She is in that That she the girl that gets murdered, That's his daughter in their daughter in there.
That's the titular daughter she played.
Mystic River in Mystic River.
Hi, all a Mystic River.
It's a pretty name.
It's it's kind of a hippy dippy name but it works, you know, works for our family.
What?
I'm getting murdered.
That's a great movie, though.
It's a great movie.
And so their eyes they're on a plane to New York and the plane actually starts to crash like the wing is peeling back and they, like, turn Jake Gyllenhaal into this like nervous Nellie.
Andi turned like this sweet moment like the wing is peeling back.
There's turbulence.
He's holding her hand, and she's like, Is this guy trying to make a move?
You know, he's actually experiencing death.
Oh, wow.
Then that that is a turnoff.
But it seems like this 15 minutes into your movie, there's nothing.
Whose attention here.
No, I know this movie's not about a plane crash.
Also know from the trailer that at some point Jake Gyllenhaal and these other people will be sitting in a library somewhere like this Does nothing for me like you're sitting there.
You're just like, all right.
So when you gonna pull out of this pilot?
Oh, you did it.
All right, well, that's over with setting up.
You know Jake Gyllenhaal as this, like the aforementioned nervous Nellie.
Yeah, well, you know, he's like he's a good kid.
He's smart, he's beautiful and gorgeous, but he wasn't.
But he's not good around the ladies, you know, and he's gotta He's gotta try to overcome that.
That's that's sort of his.
Yeah, I mean, day after tomorrow.
His So I mean, the most nerds curse is that they look like a 24 year old Jake Gyllenhaal in high schools.
Really awkward.
It's an awkward phase.
I look just like that.
It was hard as shit.
It's I know, man.
It's really, really difficult.
You turned out this modeling contract.
It's It's like every day and you just you can't get over it.
You can get and you just have to You look forward, look to the day after tomorrow and think like you know, it's gonna get better One day, one day in the dystopian hellscape that the Earth becomes.
Maybe she'll talk to me.
What person?
That's not making it to the day after tomorrow's Ian Holm.
In this movie, he makes it to the day of This is what I like to call Ian Holm and his band of Who cares?
Scientists.
This is a group of three people.
It's Ian Holm, Ah, guy who likes watching soccer and a guy who's like a newly you know, he's just become become a father, and they're just like at this weather center, and you're just looking at them and you're looking at the way like they're just like these three kind of like little unassuming people.
And because I've seen every disaster movie ever, I'm like, Well, these three are dead meat.
Put put the clock on Ian Holm the second you see him in this movie, but little hobbies, son of a bitch.
For some reason, Dennis Quaid is in India briefly.
Yeah, that's where he runs.
Runs into your home.
Yeah, that's right, Ian.
Homes walking around, going.
You know, we used to own all of this, which is why he can hail a taxi really easily.
And then it's great.
Can't.
And then I thought it was very clever of the filmmakers that we go from hailing a cab in India to someone being murdered by hail in Japan.
Weather.
Hail everyone.
I forgot about that.
Great.
Yes.
Such weather.
Hey, like these air, she's going crazy in Tokyo.
Shit is go.
You're absolutely right.
And nobody gives a shit.
That is kind.
Just I'm sorry.
Shits.
Going crazy in Tokyo is something you would see like if there was some, like event in Tokyo of any kind.
You'd see some dumb ass teenager tweet that somebody's just going crazy in Tokyo.
I just tweeted that no, somebody make me an extra large T shirt that's pink and has white letters.
It's This shit's going crazy in Tokyo, But I'll wear it.
I'll totally wear that T shirt.
We gotta get on this merch, guys, we gotta make it happen?
Yeah, that's just a really And it's the kind of It's the only scene.
I think of something like that happening at first because like, they sort of very gently usher in the idea that this big storms coming.
So it's like, yeah, hailing the taxi and then it's just like, oh, a quiet day in Tokyo.
A businessman is coming home from a long day at work, and this dude is taken out so violently you don't know what the movie is yet.
So you're like, Oh, it's just like the Japan story and he's got his own thing.
Maybe I'm watching, you know, on Neary two movie and maybe it's babble Livia's Vava Well, he's gonna go be the deaf daughter like I don't know what's gonna happen.
Maybe is in the Yakuza, maybe, And I'm like, Oh, this is cool.
Oh, no, that guy's dead.
Yeah, that shit's dead shit is going crazy assed.
They continued t show us like, Oh, they this weather is not that good in India, there was also kind of flurries happening.
It's like, Whoa, this is This is really bizarre.
Oh, yeah, But also, geese attack New York City you need.
They're landing the plane.
They're getting down to New York, going to go in their school trip.
And there's all this, all these geese descending upon the city due to help.
But that plane was being piloted by Captain Sully Sullenberger.
Does anyone that can go through geese?
That guy figured it out.
That's right.
The room.
Yeah, but it's a thing where, like, it's a casual New Yorkers.
But like the sky is black with geese like you do not.
You can't.
They are blocking out the sun.
There's so many G's and everyone just like I got to get to my beating.
It is a go go figure this, Alan way we stop and look at that.
You know you don't.
I've seen movies.
You see the lib tard movie.
The only thing only time you New Yorkers stop yeah, is when you see a Spiderman in trouble and then you're messing with everyone you know, like all those Other than that, you were very protective about our Spider Man.
Yeah, it's spotter man and pizzas with you guys.
We banded together and we save Spiderman.
Whenever he needs our help.
Every movie we wind up getting their courage up together.
Is this also the part of the movie where, like, there's a power outage in the city or something?
And all these, like I don't have the cops or security guards or whatever are going through the Central Park Zoo and it's like they totally like Goto one cage and he's like Huh, That's funny.
The guys like, Why?
Because they're New Yorkers right?
Which we choke on everywhere.
Oh yeah, one guy goes there and then the guy goes, Let it got a little trader coming Oh TT You know what?
I'll just But this guy's like, Oh, look at that.
The wall's got out living.
Yeah, wolves with the Central Park Zoo.
You see the goddamn CTO wolves?
It's easy.
I wolves go crazy.
Well, you got a bagel or pizza pizza on a bagel throw.
It's both Oh, it's working both fucking probably CG I wolves that they could fit through the boss because it's so skinny.
You know, when pizzas on a bagel you could eat that anytime.
You know how with E C G i wolves, the Mets fans go.
Yeah, Okay.
My wounds fatter.
The Mets get out of here.
Somebody opened fire.
The fire hydrant.
The wolves are out.
He's got them.
Wolves have, ah, Mets pin it up.
So it's just so the movie audience knows there's a pack of wolves running wild in the city for some reason, it just fine.
You know, whatever.
There's also something hilarious.
And it's just in homes, charming accent.
What he's trying to say is, or what he is saying.
But in my dumb American ears, he's saying nomad buoys, but he's saying it the British way.
So it sounds like nomad buoys.
Just imagine, uh, what was he trying to nomad buoys like buoys like their little ocean?
Because basically, he wasn't.
Whoa, whoa!
Is he at home talking about how it's turned?
The probably.
Oh, I think Ian Holm.
Just that Baba Booey.
Baba booey Baba booey!
Foley!
Oh, man, Vinny, this is a good fucking movie.
Good fucking movie!
Well, I was imagining your home being the wrestling manager of a tag team called the Nomad Buoys.
I was picturing a when you said Ian Holm, the nomad buoys I was picturing him and like a shitty English like Ricky Jervis era pop band, you know, like Ian Holmes's.
Maybe he's the manager of the nomad buoys that says, Still a manager, though never part of the team.
I could pitch you three movies called Ian Holm in the Nomad Buoys, and they're all better than the day after tomorrow.
For, for instance, you could do like a low budget type of Laura Lawrence of Arabia type of thing.
Yeah, man, I would love to see what a low budget Lawrence of Arabia looks like over Good God.
I'm just saying it might be dry down that Oh, that's all you said.
So in a way, I just pulled it.
Bend over and I'll show you gang.
Alright, guys got sued or dis cracked.
So it's been too much time down a goatee island.
Oh, the biggest one has to like, Oh, the world's changing is there's four tornadoes that hit Los Angeles and yeah, and my God, if there isn't the line, that tornado just took out the Hollywood sign shot.
It's crazed.
Therefore, 20 toes in downtown Los Angeles, destroying everything.
And you think Tommy Lee Jones was like, God damn it, I gotta get back out there, get the jackhammer ready.
Swept away.
That would be the greatest caviar of all time.
He reprises his role from volcano and, well, that doesn't look like a volcano, er, and then gets immediately spooked this event of this guy.
But you were saying, It's insane because like if you think about and like, people are watching this on TV like Jake Gyllenhaal on his team or watching it on TV and like this is 9 11 times four.
Man, there's fair fucking tornadoes in in a in a city area that has, like, billions of people there, thousands upon thousands of people are dying.
Everyone's just like, Wow, that's a bummer, huh?
Like having a casual conversation.
The apathy is outrageous.
You're totally right.
They're all just like, Well, look at that.
Hey, I can get some milk for this cereal.
Yeah, like, honestly, can you remember a casual conversation that happened anywhere in the country from 9 12 to 9 15?
Because it never happened.
You were just being his room when that fucking tragedy happened, and we're still a gape about it.
You're talking about that tragedy?
Yeah, its's.
It's so stupid.
And there's like, there's people in the street just watching you hit and, like I think this goes back to I was watching another Roland Emmerich movie recently i d four, Of course, to celebrate the American holiday like we do every year would let off fireworks and we watch Independent Day.
And in that movie, when all the people are like like when, uh, Vivica A.
Fox is a friend, there is like, Oh, I'm going to go up on the roof to greet the aliens and like everyone's having these like welcome aliens parties Los Angeles every one of his movies having a welcome tornadoes.
Part holder here.
It's great.
There's a fucking headphones gag in this movie, man.
Another A tornado is tearing this fucking thing apart.
This guy Sander with his headphones listening to the world cop and no one cares now, speaking with people.
That's like watching this crap.
Some dude runs out in the middle of the street and tells all these kids like how you get out of there.
Don't watch those tornadoes and then he's like, But now I can't look away.
There are tornadoes happening, and it's friend calls them and his friends like yo yo on TV about to die, and he's just like I know watching tornadoes Can't believe at the last second.
He's like, Oh, I better get into my red Porsche drive away.
Yeah, Too late.
A bus crushes.
Um, he is the producer.
Ah, this movie.
He's the producer of the, uh, whatever.
Oh, it's the, like, the local weather station.
Because here it's the radio.
It's the radio station is the guy calls.
He calls him up in the middle of the night early in the morning.
And he's like, I think we're gonna have to put out like an extreme weather alert for tornadoes of the guys.
Like half Mark.
I'm comin in.
This guy is actually the Tommy Lee Jones of day after tomorrow.
Wait, but he's a Tommy Lee Jones of radio.
Yeah, I got to see the tornadoes, but then I'll see about putting out looking like a weather center type fella.
But I guess there's something with the radio involved more than Harvey Fire Steen, station manager.
I gotta call my brother.
Oh, shit.
You know it is I got to call my lawyer.
Fuck my lawyer.
There's another weatherman is like reporting in an epicenter in between three tornadoes.
It's like guys that turn it over there.
And that trident is that way.
It isn't.
Oh, no.
He gets murdered in, like, nine seconds.
It's a realtor.
What the fuck did you think was gonna happen?
And that's one of the best deaths in the movie.
And we're only 25 minutes in because it gets it goes downhill from here.
Really hard floors.
What are you tuning into these disaster movies for if not for the hilarious deaths that occur?
Well, maybe to see Dennis Quaid's bedroom, which I want to talk about briefly.
Oh, please go ahead.
If you notice by his bed.
Uh, he's just basically sleeping on a mountain of National Geographics.
I'm thinking what everyone else is thinking.
He's jerking off.
Does photos Bingo thinking as a 45 year old man, bigger be ableto fire road pornography bill.
But it's this way if anyone catches him.
Oh, yeah?
You think I'm a scientist?
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's a research.
The old It's for research.
Excuse.
It's a disease.
There are all sorts of things, you know.
You never know when an article you might come across African breasts.
It's a possibility.
Is there a possibility although here's the thing.
Are he and Seal award divorced in this movie or what?
I guess so.
Gotta be right.
Is it like the relationship with the sun alone there?
Helen Hunt's about divorce because she they're in different spots in the country.
But they're always talking to each other.
Right?
Right, right, Yeah, And it's, you know, she is useless in this movie.
She's just saving a cancer boy, which is useless.
Oh, my God, For what?
This candle in the middle of this movie, this cancer kid shows up and I'm like, Well, great.
I mean, it's just it's unnecessary in the film because also, you know, this is what I'm talking about again, like, I know that this kid who's receiving chemotherapy, you know, and they really make him look like a raccoon eyes, bald head, like, really bad.
It was looking at home or dug its You know, they're not going to kill this kid in this?
No, of course.
So, like when seal awards like, oh, I'm going to stay behind in the hospital and pray that an ambulance shows up because this kid can't be moved by anything other than an ambulance.
I'm like, Well, that ambulance is showing up, Baby, it's just a matter of minutes.
But you didn't even have any kind of trial like, you know, think like gifts.
You'll award something to do.
Maybe she has to drive this kid herself.
Very m something, just like Pat cooling his head the entire movie.
And it's like, Well, who cares?
I don't I don't need to see Seal Award play Nurse may know.
Okay, I'm here.
I purchased a ticket for a disaster movie.
Unless that kid turns into a tornado, I don't want to see you, which that's pretty great.
Yeah, that kid, if a tornado first out of that kid's chest, he's like it wasn't cancer.
It was tornado, I cause that is just just burst over the hugest.
I would be shocked if that would.
I think that's how Tornado Man was born in Mega Man.
Tornado man.
Yeah, I was in one of the later Yeah, he's like a mega man.
Five.
They started really running out of ideas.
He threw tornadoes at you.
It was shitty, but Mega man, it's still great at this point.
Like for a while.
Dennis Quaid's bosses like you're an asshole.
You're an idiot.
You pissed off the vice president.
You're gonna get us all killed, You know that?
It's Dick Cheney.
He's gonna have his murder.
He's gonna have his waterboarded.
Yeah, you know, And he starts to have a change of heart because literally, the world is falling apart.
And even after the tornado thing in Los Angeles, Dick Cheney's just like coincidence.
Just a ridiculous way.
Do something about that Will just implies the economy that he's worried about the economy and all this.
He's like, Yeah, if we give you all this money for preventative measures, where do you think that money's coming from?
How do you think this is going to affect the working economy?
Yeah, Yeah.
How is this going to affect the rich?
Amazingly, these air still the same arguments that we're having 10 years after this movie.
Just friends, man.
Just because Toby Jones played both Karl Rove and Armin Zola and Captain America, the Winter Soldier, I'm kind of imagining like Karl Rove downloading himself into a bunch of computers when, like the day after tomorrow is happening, that is gonna Definitely I would make sure I don't know how I would do this.
A team up with the good people at anonymous.
And I would ensure that some horrendous pornography virus went into the Karl Rove computer system.
So you killed him.
Oh, e killed him.
I thought it was like all he could do is cyber sex.
Now, if it turned him into a cybersex beings cybersex strategist, he's another piece of shit, huh?
Excuse me.
Karl Rove's Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fuck that guy.
I mean, at this point, it's basically, uh you're just waiting for your weather to come.
Jake Gyllenhaal?
Is that the hunkiest fucking math decathlon I've ever seen?
Given Emmie Ross, Um, this other kid with glasses was really good looking.
Is there some sexy ass nerd?
There's not one fat kid I've seen You could do laps in these hunks eyes.
They're so dreamy, man.
Fucking lose yourself.
Swim around in those hunky browns and baby blues Blue saucers, man, Just take a dip in the o.
R.
So awkward being in high school with words I got a lift weights and read about astrophysics.
Jake Gyllenhaal, kind of for, like, four and 1/2 minutes has a romantic rival in this rich kid from another school kind of a face, like, you know, this kid.
It's totally fair.
He shows interest in Emmie Ross Emma's?
Well, yeah, kind of a thing.
And I'm like, Oh, yeah, all right.
Vampire talking about vampires and and two guys just fighting for Emmy Rossen's hard.
But I'm like, All right, I'll get a little love triangle.
Yeah, Little Spice this movie up a little bit.
That's cool.
Well, no more than 10 minutes later, does this this hunk come up to Jake Gyllenhaal?
And he's like, Hey, Jake Gyllenhaal, why don't you just tell her how you feel, man?
I'm like you dunk that.
That's the premier problem of this movie is not just to tell her how you feel, because three minutes earlier they're like, this kid's like, Oh my God, my little bro's in Philadelphia.
I gotta go pick him up.
There's no contact in Philadelphia.
I don't know what's going on, and they're like, OK, now we're trapped in New York and he he has the fucking balls to go up.
To check Dillon Hall in all of his grief would be like, you know what your little high school bullshit crush means more to me than my dead little brother clutching a school book at the bottom of a fucking ice store.
Yeah, it's, er makes no sense.
He's doing a lot of like, Oh, we can stay at my dad's house like he's the super rich, you know, Upper West Side kid or whatever.
And they go there and they yeah, good for him.
Indeed, they go there, and they hang out there for a little bit before they transport themselves to the library to hang out some more.
There's just we're finding all these places to just hang out because the storm is starting up now and we know it's serious because Oh, my God.
Vinny, did you hear this?
Fucking close.
The Holland Tunnel, O'Shea and the Lincoln Tunnel, too.
How the fuck am I supposed to get to the metal lands?
Oh, bro, you hear the Ranger game got canceled, but they never close indoors.
Morning events.
It's ridicu ous.
I can't believe this is happening.
The worst day after tomorrow, ever.
All right.
We'll talk to later.
I gotta go, uh, collect garbage, But but I collect garbage on the Upper West side.
90% of people in New York.
Collect garbage, bake and collect God.
Either you're the collect garbage.
You catch shit.
Personally, I'm gonna collect garbage.
I don't know about you.
You make garbage, you collect garbage, we eat garbage.
New York City is a great place to live, You know, They got restaurants and stuff for the rich folks, you know?
Well, sometimes someone will throw out a bagel hole.
Bangle is throwing out.
That's just how I eat.
You throw it in the garbage, I throw it in my gullet.
Oh, bro, you think when the continents shift will be a land bridge to Staten Island?
I won't have to pay that Marinzano tall.
I know what you're talking about, but I think that even more than seven easy passes no discount pasta primavera that's like 10 bucks.
So at this point, like you know your work, Ian Holm says a silent prayer and dies.
He says a prayer to be out of the day after tomorrow and is granted his way.
Well, let me tell you, this merry band of losers are like up in wherever in the Arctic Circle where this whole thing is.
I kind of started there and then on the Arctic Circle in England.
You know, they're in there in, like Greenlanders.
Yeah, Yeah, sure.
One, because they're just in, like, the middle of nothing.
Yeah, iceberg.
And ah, he's like, they're, uh they're gonna They're gonna, like, burn something or throw something out or whatever.
And it's like a bottle of scotch.
And he's like, instead of doing whatever you were gonna do, let's drink it.
Yeah, And it's just these three nothing characters toasting the toasting themselves out of the movie is the whole thing with this storm is you know, it's gonna be bringing about this new ice age, and Dennis Quaid predicts, rightfully that uh, like the temperature is gonna have a severe drop.
Like there's there's gonna be, like, high winds and some snow and one up, But it's going to get incredibly cold to the point where like unless you buy a heat source, you're going to instantly freeze to death.
You know what I call this the bullshit.
That's a good one, too.
But no, no, the D.
Q.
Blizzards.
But because you knew that was great flurries, huh?
Well, yeah, yeah, we're all gonna have to take a bite Yes, there's Think of a Dairy Queen flurry and I got all excited for ice craved.
This is sort of like ice cream, but it kills you.
Well, I guess I scream kills you, too.
Another group of losers that have nothing to do in this movie.
It's the space station we keep cutting back, man.
Why are we going to space in this movie?
And totally forgot?
And it's one of the only times in any movie where there's three characters that have their own plot, and not one of them is a recognizable actor of any kind.
Now it's just three stunt doubles floating in in a space station like fucking Roland Emmerich's three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie just hanging out.
And these assholes are so goddamn calm about everything up totally am on the space station.
Nothing can ever harm me.
Yeah, but, asshole, you're not ever coming home.
That's the thing that they don't address in the movie.
Because at the beginning, there, like, ah, hey, up their space station, we're going to get some inclement weather.
Looks like you're stuck up there for another six days.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, and they're like, all right, whatever.
But then they don't address the fact that there's no way these guys are gonna get home at least.
Well, actually, I don't know, though, because as we learn this, like ice age only hits about like Middle America.
People are fleeing from Texas to Mexico at some points.
Well, that's the big.
The big wink at the end of this movie is that all of these Americans are bombarding the Mexican border.
You imagine?
Then what a world, huh?
Did you?
I think Sharon, Sarah Palin would rather put a gun in her mouth and commit suicide than do that.
I'd watch that broadcast that on pay per view, I'll pay whatever money you want.
Oh, yeah?
Well, yeah.
You really lebatard episode we're putting up here, huh?
You can't help it.
But with this with this thing, this plot of this movie.
But, you know, it lets us imagine if the shoe was on the other foot.
Yeah.
How would we react if we wanted to go to Mexico?
Well, what's amazing is I think in that end, wrap up of what's going on is ah, you hear a newscaster say something to the effect of like in order for Mexico to be cool with this.
Ah, the United States has agreed to forgive all of Latin America's debt to the United States.
That's like a thing that's just dropped at the end of the movie, like s O to make this.
Okay, Latin America doesn't know his money anymore.
Open your doors to us from Latin America.
I'm like, uh, do you want better?
That's like going to prison with somebody that owes you money.
And, you know, he's much bigger than you like, Dude, that's debts resolved.
No matter what, you know, like next thing you need to do for me exactly time we need to be calling in our debts, you know, because, like, half of your taxpayers, you're dead at least.
Will you know what?
What is going on here?
Well, that's the problem is that last two acts of this movie is all just Dennis Quaid getting his ass to fuck in New York.
But we we should speed that up because there's a whole new world order that I'd rather see because America's Day World Order, it would have to be right.
Like Power's out.
I don't have powers ever coming back.
I mean, well, yet you're totally right.
I want to see the day after the day after tomorrow And what that is like rebuilding society.
What fuck give me next week at this road?
We're going towards the road with Viggo Boiled Man.
What a snoop I would prefer that would be the road less traveled.
I don't want to go down that road.
I don't want to go down that road, either.
I kind of like that movie, though.
I know it's an unpopular opinion, but it's totally fun.
Eyes it that you like that movie?
Yes, because, as I say in the show all the time, it's perfectly fine for anybody to like any movie.
So I know all you tomorrow heads just, you know, keep in mind.
This is a fun program.
We do.
From time to time, they will themselves.
Dad heads Huey Dewey and Louie Emmerich are really gonna come after us, But right now I mean, the whole Northern Hemisphere is covered in ice like it's not just America.
It's the whole Northern Hemisphere Europe.
Europe's done like the world is different and we don't see any of it because we're just watching Jake Gyllenhaal burned books like That's It and just like blow on his hands and look at his watch waiting for Dad to come home.
Let's talk about the book burning because this is some of the dumbest moments like these are some of the dumbest moments in this movie.
So there is the librarian who stayed behind in the library.
Then there's like some nerd Linger frequents the library and then, like a younger girl, uh, he's probably, like, 20 or so.
This nerd lingers.
Maybe, like in his thirties.
And my God, the conversations about what books were burning.
How dare you burn any book in the first place?
This guy's keeping a Bible like all of this shit about burning books.
It's disgusting.
And at the end of it, the nerd linger and the young girl fall in love like they totally are making fuck eyes at each other over the Holik while we live through this icij.
But at least we have their their books.
There's time now.
There's all the time now to read all your books and be romantic in this goddamn disaster movie.
Goddamn lib charged not not burning their books when they need to burn them.
Their books.
Are there a burn the books or four?
Let's make that a paper.
What made books?
What made him?
Apparently.
Listen, if the world is turning into the next ice age, I'm burning every book around.
Yeah, I don't care.
At that point, I don't wear one around to be Why I Oh, yeah, totally.
Books be damned you little.
Anyway, I'm gonna kill the weakest one in the bunch.
Use him the cook up.
You know, you need be sure unless I can.
If I can get out there and kill some of those cg I wolves roast them up.
I'm having a Chris cabin pulled pork sandwiches.
What I'm having.
Ah, slow cooker, man.
Have Evan.
I bet that's delicious.
It's got to be eat all his knowledge.
What if it was actually like that movie ravenous and gained the persons like soul or whatever?
You know that I would not eat Chris can?
No.
No.
So Dennis Quaid makes another appeal to the president.
Who is George Bush surrogate.
He gets, he gets Ah, Jeff.
Gold bloomed all the way to the White House.
So, like, you're the only guy that saw this coming.
Yeah.
Come on in.
Let's talk about it.
And he gives this presentation.
And at this point, New York is flooded and freezing, you know.
Ah, L A has 17 tornadoes.
We don't know what's going on in the middle America.
I don't see any of that major cities, only as always.
Well, that's where you think all those tornadoes would be.
But that's like I mean, the whole thing is like, you're seeing whether that you normally wouldn't see place in the wrong spot.
And like, there's so much evidence at this Dick Cheney guy, it's too, because Dick Cheney, smarter than this Dick Cheney would look okay.
It's a national emergency.
We have to do something for my life is threatened.
You will give me the soul of a baby.
This is subtle political commentary on that is ridiculous.
But still, it's so stupid because all you need to do is drop a few nuclear warheads into the heart of the storm.
No, no.
Trust me on this.
This will make things a little warmer.
Yeah.
Yep.
It will spend the 22 the other way.
Exactly.
Thank you.
Finally, someone gets versus the polarity.
cross the stream.
You've got to do all of it.
You just work or you gotta eject the warp core pressure.
You definitely have to 88 miles around, By the way, in this way, well, they're hiding on the library.
And then, you know New York's flooded.
Now there's water everywhere because there's there's a big sequence where a huge tidal wave just buries everything.
She's gotta help.
There's a scene where Jake Gyllenhaal has to help m e from Emmie Ross.
Um, from Yeah, a taxi because she's helping tourists.
Yeah, she's helping some French tourists because they're the first.
The fucking go shit goes down in New York City.
Oh, no, that's that's that's talking about pulled pork sandwiches.
I'm sorry.
This is the fucking some affected pulled pork, Croquette says.
He'll give you the straight dope today.
It's ridiculous.
She's like, Oh my God, it's one of these cities where everyone keeps looking back.
There's a wall of water as tall as a statue of fucking liberty, and everyone's running about.
Run 12 steps.
Look back, Run 12.
Step it still coming.
It's coming and I'll tell you what The speed at which this this river This fucking tidal wave is coming down Fifth Avenue, compared to the time that they waste puttering around outside of this library does not match up.
They'd be dead six times over like, you see this thing rushing down the street and you're like, Wow, that's coming pretty fast.
And like any Rocinha has time to go find out what's going on with these tours.
And it's just that this woman doesn't speak English, but she doesn't understand that the guy is fucking gas like the guys like the water is like up to the windows.
I have to get you out of this car.
And the guy's like she doesn't speak English.
She doesn't know what's going on.
I'm like, Listen, in this case, this woman would know ticket out of the car.
She thinks it's a hotel room back here, just taking a dump.
Welcome to Bo America.
Speak New York.
And then soon after this fucking scene, a goddamn giant boat is floating around Manhattan.
Oh, there's it's It's a Russian like tugboat Vinnie.
The Titanic's just a raft.
Well, better late than never, says Cheech Marin's.
Maybe they both got calzones on it or what, bro I opened up his Russian freighter and inside was six.
Counted six tons of God.
Goal!
Oh, man.
How about was there any of them up those?
All those babes down a Brighton beach?
Really?
Of them on their toes.
Russki babes were inside it.
Well, I think they were there for the sex trade.
The day after tomorrow warped the sex trade.
I am picky.
No, you haven't seen that movie.
Ah, Eastern promises.
That's how it's like, bro.
That's how that's how they do it over there.
You mean fighting a guy naked in a sauna?
No, I mean whatever the fuck cut cells up to.
Oh, right.
I'm a big New York guy, but I also don't move in to sell it.
Just because I shoveled garbage and eat it for a living doesn't mean I ain't cultured in the areas of art cinema.
I know David Cronenberg.
You know, those movies get released in New York before, anywhere.
So technically, I got the fucking leg up here, all right?
Oh, man.
I saw breathless and film for a less we kid borrowed.
Is that a good movie?
Oh, mercy.
So they're holding.
It doesn't make sense to be holed up in the library because not even that high of a building.
Well, that's the thing.
This movie likes to pretend that also there to issues of skyscrapers everywhere in Midtown.
Yes.
And they like to pretend that this library is bigger.
You know that it is taller than it is, but also what they're doing.
This movie that's a lipid.
Infuriating is they keep doing the Hey, if you're looking for us, we're at the library van.
You know what New York has, like 10,000 library branches.
We're at the library.
Well, they are the original.
Just to the Bryant Park Library or fucking the Ghost Busters library, you know.
Are you guys in the library from Ghostbusters?
Okay.
Got it.
Yeah, it's full of ghosts now, because we're all dead.
Yeah, I'm making more ghost by killing and then eating people.
Exactly.
So he talks to his dad is like, sweetie, I'll pick you up in two days, and he's like, Okay?
And he gets e starts like packing up like Dennis Quaid has failed.
Has convinced the president the vice president, to evacuate America.
So right?
And he's like, Well, I guess the only thing left is to pack up and get my son.
And he goes to get his son and his two friends.
Dash me Hawk Jay O Sanders, Character acting deal.
That's Joo Sandy.
Yeah, Yeah.
Wow.
They're like, Oh, will come with you, Writer.
Die Because I want to go to New York and freeze to death.
It's like, Whoa, what's that?
Team leader Dennis Quaid.
You're picking up your dumb son during this thing.
Good luck.
Yep.
See you.
Never again.
That's impossible.
That's like doing a three point turn in a garbage truck in a middle of a blizzard.
All you were diving a habit of lizard, bro.
The funny thing is, he probably would have got there faster and not had to spare some lives if it just went by himself.
Exactly.
Jay O Sanders falls to his death of this.
Move immediately.
Almost immediately.
Look into a mini mall or into a shopping mall.
No, legit shop is really everything there.
So we're walking over the frozen tundra which used to be America, right?
Think about that shit.
Ah, and it's on top of lib tard.
They fall in through minimal and like, you know they're doing like a kind of, ah, you know, Northern Track.
Everyone's connected to each other via rope.
Sojo Sanders cuts away the sled.
Ah, it's still still a little too heavy.
The glass starts to crack and they're like, Oh, no, no, no.
Hold on.
We'll get you to sick.
No hero's death for me.
This'd for Jake Gyllenhaal Hall and he cuts himself free.
But you don't see him fall.
They cut away.
And that's the big problem for me.
It's like, How dare you come?
I want us.
I want to hear that because we see the sled fall.
Yeah, and that thing shatters across an escalator.
Yeah, I would love to see this fella shatter crossing.
I want him to go right into a coconuts, you know, just right, like buckets, CDs or sticking out all over him.
Or he crashes into a fountain and a bunch of pennies go fine.
But you're so right.
Like where?
Where?
The balls on this disaster movie man.
All I can keep thinking about is a certain someone in volcano melting into lava.
Exactly, and it's a hero's death to You can get away with making it horrific.
You know, like just like you know, he's living it for everybody.
But what's great, though, is that that whole time he's like threatening to cut.
He's trying to make the decisions ways, looking a bit like the glass that they're standing on like cracking.
And he's like, Should I do this or not?
And the whole time Dennis Quaid's like No, seriously, put that knife away, we can figure this out.
He's like, No, I think I'm gonna take the hero's way out.
You know?
He's like, No, no, no, no, no, please, Whatever you do, don't cut that rope.
Will have you saved in, like, two seconds?
No, no, no.
You're welcome suicide.
And it's just like for what?
Like honestly for nothing.
It's a body count you don't see.
We keep coming back to seal award in Cancer boys reading a fucking Peter Ban, and it's like, Well, congratulations, this movie's any slower than it was five minutes ago.
Somehow seal awards a good actor, but like man, is she just doing nothing in this movie that I could not care less like if you deleted every scene of hers after like her and Dennis Quaid get off the phone at the beginning of this movie.
It would be fine.
It would be like a garlic seal Award.
Played his ex wife for, like, two seconds.
That was weird.
But it would be way better than cutting back to her in Cancer Boy.
Just wasting my time.
This movie is, like, two and 1/2 hours long or something like that.
They could have peppered this up a little bit, you know?
Have cancer, boy played by I don't know, the kids in the halls.
Bruce McCulloch.
Give it a little something funny.
Way to go.
And it is just a little something extra.
It's a short guy.
Still playing, kid.
Yeah, I think he had a character similar to this once.
I don't know.
Hey, I just, uh I noticed in my notes something stupid to tack on to how stupid the Ian Holm storyline is.
Right when they're about to freeze to death and die in the drinking.
That scotch, they do like a toast.
You know, er toe start death, he goes, Ah, they all say one.
Right.
So it starts with Yeah, fuck it.
They go to England, to mankind, to Manchester United.
Because huge soccer.
Yeah.
So the team everybody hates to thio Bilbo Baggins.
He said J r tell to the Hughes Brothers from hell now available on home video.
Never really sucks.
Want Ian Holm is in it, you know, it is he may be Jack the Ripper in that movie he made just e I don't remember how that movie ends.
They kind of just said the they all would imply that he's the jacket.
Yeah, because parts of that I couldn't want to rewatch it.
To be honest, I haven't seen that.
Well, I saw it in theaters and I was a big fan of the book.
And I remember being like, really And I didn't know the book.
It's a good one.
Oh, there's also a funny book.
The funny Book of Pictures In It Funnies.
The Funnies.
It's funny pages.
It's the funny pages.
So we've got wait out the movie we've also got before they're on.
They're like, you say, wipe out.
I'm gonna do a belly flop from the fucking Statue of Liberty.
Look out, whales.
Here I come.
I have the only man that's ever gonna survive.
The second I say any cat hat it was keeping myself warm.
It wasn't called wipe.
It was splashed.
Those wipe out the wipeout is the show where idiots try to run across things to get knocked in the water.
Celebrity?
Why don't get unnerved out They get the other, like, big nerve things hit them and they fall.
The one splash was Yeah.
Yeah.
Where?
Where Louie Anderson jumps off a building into a glass of water?
Yeah, it's him.
And then a carnival horse.
They both do it.
Yeah, I know.
Wipe out was It was hosted by, um that, uh, dude who used to do talk soup.
Yeah, John.
No, John.
Hence I'm dicking about it now.
Like so Los Angeles is destroyed, right?
Yeah.
New York is mostly destroyed.
What if at the end, when all said and done the day after day after tomorrow, Louie Anderson is the greatest living actor Like what if What if we get down to that?
Thank God.
I was on vacation in Minnesota when all of Hollywood was wiped out a wipe outs on.
I'm rebooting the diehard franchise necks week.
Right?
When I'm done playing Lincoln Blue, he edits it is buddy Spielberg's Lincoln four score and seven beers ago.
We gotta get this amendment through.
Oh, man.
I guess I have to be Ray Charles in this file.
Pig.
John.
John John A cz.
I don't know the word I'll practice.
And the Academy Award for best actor goes to Louie Anderson For all of the movies he's ever done this year, as he's our only living actor, please welcome Louie Anderson to the stage.
Louis, would you like to come on down, please?
You're the only man in the audience.
I drink your milkshake.
I drink all of, um, in the home milkshake shop.
Louie Anderson.
Remakes of Oscar winning movies Might be my new favorite thing.
I need kids to work in my factory.
They got the little arms to get into machines.
Come on.
You kind of give me the cans.
Should have to do G.
I Joe retaliation next week and I have to play all the characters.
Uh huh.
Let's go, Jos.
Okay, Jones.
I'm gonna get you.
Jones.
My favorite movie that I've done so far is blue is the warmest collar.
It's me playing two lesbian teenagers.
Wait, who am I talking to?
Oh, my God.
Louie Anderson and Blues.
The water's color I just threw up inside.
So we're still waiting at this library, huh?
Yeah.
Waits on his way.
Andrew, this is something we We neglected to mention a little detail.
Back when Emi Rawson was saving those useless tourists, she cuts herself on the bumper of the cab.
Oh, now flash forward to where we are in the film she's got sepsis is kicking in good old fashioned sepsis, which we diagnose.
So shut the librarian just reading symptoms from a book which it's It's like, Oh, aren't you glad we didn't burn all these books?
Now just a monologist power.
So then they just like, Well, if we don't have any antibiotics, she's gonna die.
Jake Gyllenhaal's Well, there's a boat.
Chances are that boat.
There's gonna be exactly what we need.
Yeah, the shitty Russian freighter on an automated freighter.
Maybe that's frozen in midtown Manhattan.
Just baby.
There's a usable first aid kit on there that has penicillin and whatever God else we need, uh, there probably won't be that, but there's definitely gonna be some CG I will go.
Yeah, somebody says that the audience who still woke up these Wolves.
Man are just trotting around this thing.
And it's Jake Gyllenhaal and his two friends, the hunk and his nerdy friend like Okay, we're all gonna go together because we literally bored out of our skulls being in this library for three days, and I'd love to stretch my legs and then run afoul of the wolves and the hunky character who is no longer a romantic rival.
You know, he's a good guy.
He gets bitten by a wolf but doesn't die like again, like he needs to get fucking like raped by four walls.
The whole, like the whole What I needed to see the whole pack of them just eats this guy alive.
Exact sacrifices himself.
So Jake Gyllenhaal, that nerd can get through the door.
Or at very least, he turns into a wear one because you know what it's like.
Oh, Dennis Craig could be like, Oh, this this storm is it's changing the way the world works.
Magic is coming back.
It's sort of like Game of thrones with the dragons.
You know, Magic's back in the world.
Winter is coming G up.
Boom.
Yep, You're right.
With with with coming with the coming Winter comes, you know, the rise of magic.
D'oh magics.
It would be exactly like certainly Mingus too.
So favorite character on game of thrones to play was Cal Drago.
I e also had to blame.
Can we see that was fun to shoot, if you know what I mean.
Hey, guys, you can't you can't see it, but I'm winking.
They wrote her a.
I can do with this impression.
They wrote her aged up a little bit, but I still played her like she was in the books is a 13 year old.
That's how I envisioned what Cal Droga was doing.
I need motivation for both of my characters.
I won 40 won Emmys last year.
I also wrote Breaking Where Hey guys in this post apocalyptic society were home the only creative figure I brought back all my favorite shows Breaking Ban Life with Louis.
I got another job for your Uncle Jack.
Everybody's back from the dad.
Welcome back to go.
I was also a big fan of Roseanne.
Now I'm playing Roseanne.
Then this fall on NBC.
Louie Anderson does whatever he wants from it P M.
To 10 via and then the local news like the chair Spence that you think it's somebody else and it's Louie Anderson again.
That's all the news for tonight.
Stay tuned for the Tonight Show starring me.
Give me a few minutes to get over the other studio and get everything set up.
The suicide rate would be through the roof like, honestly skyrocket.
It wouldn't be the lack of food and be the lack of entertainment.
Sustenance.
Welcome.
The Late Night with Louie Anderson and now last call with ruinous for last call.
Oh, that's just never giving canceled.
Hey, guys, I want to tell you about the magic bullet.
You can make all kinds of smoothies.
It's four in the morning.
Oh, no, here ends our broadcast day, but I'm not going to sleep.
Be I would kill myself for a week Today show at 4 30 in the morning or whatever.
Oh, man.
And then he keeps losing all this weight, right?
Because he's working so much, it loses all of his charm and wow and you're right.
And that's when he loses America.
That's what people turn the two now that he's not fat anymore.
Turn it off.
He's worked himself down to being horrendously dangerously skinny.
I don't know this.
So the kid doesn't die of Via Wolf.
Who cares?
No.
Doesn't even have the courtesy to turn into a goddamn where Wolf just gets back inside safely.
Everyone gets back inside safely.
We don't even see any Rawson.
Take the medicine or get better.
No, she just liked gets up towards the end of the movie when Dennis Quaid comes to pick everybody up in the minivan.
Also, when they're running away from the wolves to get get back into the library there also running away from the personification of Cole.
Oh my God, they outrun cold in this movie is like it's like Sam Remy's evil Dead.
Yeah, like that's like the cold is chasing them way.
See the Empire State Building get even colder.
It just cracks up a little bit.
It's like, Oh my God, it's even colder out there.
They run into, like they all go into, like, one room in the library where there's this huge, this huge midi evil fireplace that I'm sure is in the New York Public Library, and they're all hiding in this room.
They're thrown whatever books at this point because the cold's coming.
It's the cold snap and you see the door freeze and the cold like comes through the cracks like, Ah, here I come.
It's so stupid.
They're like, right there like, Oh, you have to keep the fire on.
Like if it's if the cold is that intense that it's like actually chasing you, you're all dead.
You're so I don't care what fire you have.
What?
James Joyce volume.
You're burning your alm ordered.
There's a hilarious thing where you learn about this cold snap that's, you know, gonna hit our characters eventually.
It's like kind of around the time it's hitting Ian Holm, which also you don't see those fuckers die.
They toast, and that's the last time you see them.
But there's a couple of helicopters that run into this cold snap and the chopper's free mid air and crash and this guy gets out like what's going on around here?
And you see this human being like, instantly freeze And I was like, Can that start happening for, like, the whole movie?
Yes, it's gonna happen.
More people.
Oh, what's that?
It's just that one guy.
Oh, great.
And also I don't know if we mentioned it, but they were.
There was a group of dissenters in the New York Public Library.
That's like, No, we're gonna go outside, but over.
We're gonna walk with everyone else for safety.
Oh, man, I think Nunzio Zobel, Let's go get a slice and everyone puts the coat side and leaves.
Jake Gyllenhaal has to give this big speech about like, now if you go out there, my dad says you're gonna die.
My dad's coming and he says, You're all gonna die if you leave And they're like, Who the fuck is this kid?
He's like my dad created this kind of God.
He's not most 28 year old.
They shoved him and they go on die almost instantly.
Yeah, yeah, we get we get a nice shot of Ah, the cop that was in the party frozen to death.
So that's good, but you don't see it transform.
That's why I like the transformation of the S.
And I would like Yes and transformers for sure.
I would like you know, that movie the last winter when it's a harm.
It's an ecological horror movie.
It's not with Ron Perlman.
Yeah, it's not better than this one, but it is.
No, it is better than this movie by a lot, but a lot.
There's a dinosaur.
Ghosts Come wait, Shut up.
I'm serious.
I mean, like they don't It's not as cheesy as it sounds unfortunate.
They kind of take the high road, which is kind of a problem.
May damn it.
Hold on a second.
There's a blizzard with the earth freezes.
Yeah, and then the ghosts of dinosaurs, you rise from the crypt dinosaurs.
Mastodons like Are they coming out of the fucking gas tanks?
Well, it's there in Antarctica and they're like, Oh my God, the planet is revolting against us.
It hates us for what we've done to it, right?
And I think there's primal things happening.
Dinosaur goes.
Sounds like I need to watch this with a nice cold glass of water.
It is a fucking Scientology.
I feel like if there's one person who's not putting up with Scientology, it's Ron Pearl fucking bunch of Scientology.
That's face.
So whatever Dennis Quaid makes it to the library he does with with no incident after Jay o Sanders commit suicide for no reason.
Everything's gravy.
If he pitches a tent with that other guy.
Have a dash me hog like they're like the snap happens.
And he's like, You know me, Hawks, like, you know, we've got to wait this out for a couple of days and then Dennis Quaid like, Well, I don't think he has a couple of days and like me, it's just like I should just be like, I don't give a fuck.
We have maybe the last two people alive on Earth that you know what?
I'm pitching this tent and I'm gonna a good night's sleep.
Yeah, exactly.
It's shit.
You and your dumb genius child.
I know it's my fault for even agreeing to come on this bullshit trip.
You.
We are taking one for me.
Hawk today.
Guess what?
Guess what?
Guess what?
Keep walking.
Yeah, exactly the tense in my bag.
Keep walking.
So, by the way, it's now sub arctic.
It's like negative 98 degrees.
Don't worry.
We vet a thin like vinyl sheets protecting us elements.
Fine.
Oh, and by the way, I also love my giant goddamn phone that I could talk to the astronauts and outer space with He makes a phone call the astronaut.
Yeah, Yeah, he was ready.
They were GPS thing.
And he's like, Hey, uh, hey, astronauts has it going up there, and they're like, fun, man, we got fucking 100 yearsworth of Tang.
Yeah, man, When did those guys go mad?
Do you think that's a very real thing?
I only want to see you like that.
That's good.
You keep checking back up with these.
Who cares?
Astronauts that somebody's just holding somebody else's eyeballs.
Fucking event horizon comes to fruition like fucking hallowed space is happening like they've lost their minds to such a degree, just blood and guts everywhere in chains.
For some reason, I feel you just remind me of something funny because I recently finished watching the entire Hellraiser filmography, which, if you want to talk about wastes of time, put that up there.
There's like, what, 1.4 usable hours and the entire thing is what we should do a fan master cut.
But you just reminded me of the idea that in a lot of these sequels they're just shitty scripts for, like, horror thrillers that they were like, Yeah, we could stick center bites in this and they just make them hellraiser movies, right?
I was digging.
Do you think if Event Horizon didn't find enough funding, they would have just made it a hell Raiser?
You put pinhead in that movie, man.
Perfect one means he fixed.
Sam Neill kind of turns into pinhead at the end of that movie.
Yeah.
Doesn't like, have his skin's all ripped off.
Yeah, that's Paul Ws Anderson.
It is that Zack's movie?
Yeah, yeah, actually, kind of enjoyed it.
I don't know if I like that or Mortal Kombat, but that's a good question.
That's fucking Sophie's choice starring me, Louis.
And I'm remaking the old ones because all the film canisters froze E.
I got to go back and do everything now know frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
And the by, my dear, I mean my cat that that's the only co stars he would ever have would be cats.
And here's my cast of characters, cats and dogs.
The creepiest line in this movie is uttered when Dennis Quaid gets to this library, so like he gets there and they're all sleeping like all the survivors.
So like nerd lingers with like that young lady and They're, like, keeping each other warm, you know, if you know what I'm saying.
Yeah, And then, like, you see that shit happened, by the way.
You know what I just showed you say?
I say they were getting down to some fucking in the library.
You got a body heat number one Exactly.
Got more body heat scene, but doesn't go anywhere.
Oh, that's right where she's like, I'm gonna press up against you and we're gonna hug.
And he's definitely got a Jake Gyllenhaal nerd boner.
And she's just like, Yeah, it's disgusting.
Urine mirrored right.
That's what happened.
This is her saying that to him and then like, it's cold.
But so, like, Dennis Quaid's looking around.
He's that kind of sure hope my son isn't dead.
He's got this flashlight and, like, the flash light comes on Jake Gyllenhaal.
And like he comes on, Yes, it comes upon Jake Gyllenhaal.
I didn't really make it better.
And so he wakes up and Jake Gyllenhaal just goes like he sees that it's Dennis Quaid because hi, Father.
I'm like, Wait, did you get turned into a pod person?
I'm a man now.
I have had intercourse.
I had sex with this girl who has blood poisoning Dick boys.
Well, that's the funny thing is like you could contract sepsis sexually.
For whatever reason, no one grows beards in this movie like especially Jake Gyllenhaal, because they want to make him look like a 17 year old kid.
But like, it stays there passing though the day the day after tomorrow, Thio 7 to 10 days because they said the storm's gonna last 7 to 10 days.
00 you're right.
There definitely would be rampant.
Cannibalism that Absolutely I, uh rats A missed opportunity all around.
They would they would eating those first?
Yeah, he's starting the subway rats.
That's good.
Eat like in a demolition man.
So, you know, at this point, we're all in Mexico.
Not everybody.
Just the one of the things that happens off screen is the president dies.
The president's like, tryingto wait out the storm.
And then it's like, Mr President, we really have to shag some ass here.
Mr.
President, you're dead.
You see, You see him like getting a helicopter, and then the lady who's like the secretary of Defense walks in.
Dick Cheney, of course, is already in Mexico.
1st 1 there.
Its own Mexico now.
Oh, yeah?
Did you flag that have to do?
And she's like, I sir, um, So you're the president.
Now, watch that like, Oh, well, the president didn't get out in time and his caravans frozen instantly.
So you're wrapped.
You're You're the president.
Now, that's what I'm saying is Well, gosh, golly, that's great news.
So he s now it's under NAFTA, and we have the Amero I'm imagining That's the That's the currency way combined.
The United States, Mexico and Canada.
Well, you got to be done for.
Yeah, And And you know what, shitty ass?
Ah, Hollywood movie.
Not one mention of our friends to the north know what their situation is?
The mines will not even be a country.
They're they're like, all America is going to get slobbered.
They're gonna get slobbered by this storm.
I think of it this it clobbered but don't like slobber it.
It's like a It's like a dog of winter.
Storm comes and slobber but stick Cheney learns a little lesson from this whole thing, you know, and like, he gives this big speeches like, you know, we're all we all learned a little lesson in humility, and by that I mean 2/3 of the country is dead.
It's mostly because years ago I didn't listen to this scientist who turned out to be 100% right on everything he told me.
Well, for some reason, the carpet made bank.
So whatever some reason, the American system of government still exists, even though he's doing it from a Mexican embassy.
It's a good look.
It's and it's the purge anarchy out there.
Okay, best case scenario.
It's all happening.
Yeah, and so he gives a speech.
And then, like the the Dennis Quaid's bosses, like Oh my God, Dennis Quaid.
It's stuck in New York, and Dick Cheney's like, Well, I better fucking dispatch nine helicopters to get six people, which these helicopters must have, what, 1/10 of the world's energy supply at this point.
But there's nothing left.
Look, I'm sorry that New York is closed for business, yet we're close, you know, it's it's the city that never sleeps until the Ice Age comes.
Then we're closed for a couple of days and he gives the speech and he's giving.
The speech is like, and I even dispatched helicopters because some really nice guy stuck in New York.
If I was watching this somehow, you know, eating my father, I'd be like, What the fuck?
What?
Second helicopters for white people, you know, like, I would be so mad.
What I love, too is so they pick up Jake Gyllenhaal and company and you their helicopters.
So you fit in, like, five people in there, and they're flying by Manhattan.
He's getting, like, one last look.
And there's all these people on rooftops and, like, sometimes helicopters, air coming down for that nose at the time, You just kind of up there for no reason like a jerk.
And we did not bring enough fuel for two trips.
Will tell you that much.
Yep.
So, uh, hope you liked looking at this helicopter?
Oh, Marone, Vinnie, um, from the mayor now, I guess, bro, that's fucked up.
I would have voted for you anyway, though.
All those fucking WASPy scientists get the first helicopter.
It's fucked up.
Pro us ladies got to stay here.
We're gonna be eating the garbage of the old world.
And, ah, not shockingly.
Those astronauts air in space forever.
Oh, yeah, though they're the last characters we see in the movies.
They were chorus everybody yes, on.
They tell everyone like Oh, my God, this storm is going forever.
Have you ever seen the earth so blue?
Oh, yeah, Beautiful.
It's the computer image from the Earth that Apple uses with iPhones.
When you initially get an iPhone and he's like the picture, it's that exact picture.
How did that work?
Did Apple get it from the day after tomorrow?
And vice versa.
I think it's like someone made it and gets license.
I think Roland Emmerich just held up his phone.
Oh, wait, this was 2004.
So wait, Did it exist?
I don't know.
That's up to you, listener.
I can't help is this?
Ah, because that's the end of the day.
It's it's terrible and dull.
Is this Roland Emmerich's dullest movie?
I didn't see that 10,000 B.
C.
Well, I didn't see that.
That's him.
At least there's like I don't know, sabertooth tigers doing shit in there.
It's gotta be an exciting than this.
This was a total snooze fest.
It's a total snooze fest, and like I'm sorry, keep your you're beating me over the face messages out of my dumb summer blockbuster.
I agree.
Even even if we personally think, Hey, you know, maybe we should give a shit about the environment.
Don't fucking shove it down my throat when I'm shoving popcorn down there already.
There's not room for both.
And I'm gonna keep eating this popcorn, especially when you make a bad movie.
It just actually weakens everyone's position.
Yes, that's exactly so, Uh, what's this?
What's this pamphlet about global warming?
That's it.
Is that bad movie?
Fuck that garbage.
It's like getting a pamphlet, you know, in the rare case that someone actually takes a pamphlet from someone else, which is never.
But if it were to happen and the first thing you notice on the pamphlet is that there's, like, a gigantic spelling error.
We're just like, Well, this is a fucking waste of time because the people who made it are idiots, and this is what this is.
And then you're making it again with 2012.
But that's like Maur the Mayan prophecy than anything else.
That move is a real stink fest to butt in that movie.
They have the audacity to be like what we've been planning for this for a long time because the mines told us so.
We've built all of these super ships that people are gonna live on.
At least that's something you know.
There's a sci fi element to it.
This is like grounded and boring.
Bullshit.
Well, it's not even reality.
It's grounded in like boring fantasy.
You mean, is that What if we had to walk across America?
Ah, to a library and it was really cold out that walk across America.
Ah said, That's him and Forrest Gump, right?
I'm gonna do Maybe I'll just cut that part from the story.
What's this about?
A barracks, a chair?
Eclipse?
More about that, the whole movies about the chocolates.
Now forget the Vietnam warm.
Just eat more chocolate than I play the Elvis cameo.
Remember, Elvis is in for a school because I think, he said, he has to go pee, and now I'm chemically get a God.
Louie Anderson and JFK back into the laugh.
Guys, come on, it's back into the last.
How can you not see this?
It's not a conspiracy.
It's riel e like playing the way night part because the pants fit the best.
Wait, I love the idea that he's just using all of you Have todo got a wing alone.
I gotta wiggle into Kevin Costner's suit.
Now that's a conspiracy theory.
What?
That's the day after tomorrow from Roland Emmerich 2004.
What a what a disaster movie and not in the way I wanted it to be.
Yeah, if you want to get a hold of us know recommends by the Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so so done with this movie.
No, I'm sorry, but no one is recommending.
No, no, no, no, no.
If you want to watch a Roland Emmerich Billy watch Independence Day volcanoes a better, much better, more watchable.
If you want to see l.
A get lit up, it's gonna get lit up good.
I mean, there's a ton of good.
I mean, I like a good disaster.
We're going into each other.
It's smashing and crashing.
Absolutely.
Just none of that happens or it happens, and then we go to a library.
The last place I want to be when I'm at the movies is at the library.
We could talk about books and the merits of one book over another and which one should be burned.
That's a debate for a Twilight Zone episode of Feel That's not here now.
