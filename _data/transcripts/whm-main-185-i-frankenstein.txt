Hello, Amanda.
Jew Been Eric Cisco, Steven's head and we hate movies.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome toe.
We hate movies.
Thank you for tuning in as always.
Welcome to 2015.
It's the first episode of 2015 so you start off on a clean slate.
Anyone who's new to the program, This is a comedy show where we take a movie that we don't like or we do like.
And then we just food, poke a couple of holes in it and have a little fun along.
That's radio for poking holes in things.
You got a boo boo boop it the greatest of ease listening for like the whole time and decided from that description that wait, what they do.
What?
Oh, what have I been listening to?
I feel like an idiot.
That is a political show click that's him hanging up on our television or podcast, whatever, whatever it is, you know what?
It's a new year.
We took a whole week off.
Might be a little rusty.
Sure, you know, these things happen.
Um, so, yeah, for anyone who's who's new, welcome.
Like we said at the top, I'm Andrew.
Oh, this this voice right here This is Eric Cisco.
I'm a different guy, and I am yet another different person.
Um, my voice sounds like this.
My name's Steve.
And then there's 1/4 guy who's not here right now.
His name is Chris, and that's a different voice.
Yeah, that he's got another voice.
So we are.
Collectively, we hate movies, and there's no video component to this shit.
No, no, no.
That through turn your turn your sets off.
Just way record this.
I close my eyes, so I'm kind of experiencing it with you.
Eric was like, I want to know what it's like to record a podcast.
Blind.
Yeah, And he hasn't stopped since I learned it from what was a Derek Jacoby Is blue eyes that know Derek Jarman?
Yeah, Billy, a guy I knew.
I knew you'd get it.
Wow, That's the second time that that movies come up for me in a couple weeks.
Really?
I was telling my students about it a few weeks back.
Leda shrimp man like Repo Man.
Now, if you're an old pro at this show and you're looking at the 3 14 market, we haven't mentioned the name of the movie.
It means we really fucking hate.
All right, so let's just bite down on it real quickly we're talking about I went by the way, January.
It's our worst of the previous year.
Month?
Yes.
So these air all movies from last year from 2014 that we despised.
They're not necessarily the absolute worst movie.
Because sometimes we just can't bring ourselves to talk about those.
Ah, but they're bad movies that we didn't care for.
And it's from the year 2014.
Now I get we normally have a 10 year rule in place, which means that we don't do movies that are, you know, not at least 10 years old.
But obviously we break that for this would be great if you trolled all like all big major movie websites with, Like, you're saying that this move you say that I Frankenstein was worse.
Unlike in her ass, 16 like, just troll it with just porno title like because theoretically, those air movies and these are not the words.
I Frankenstein is a much better movie than drastic.
I think I'd rather watch interes No, because by the time you got to 16 men, the direction which they took that franchise was just silly.
I mean, once you you only go to space ones.
Yeah, that's the problem.
You go to space twice.
I'm like you go to space four times.
There's a real issue with your franchise with the her ass friends.
You know, you would be great if it was like inner space.
Oh, man.
Like maybe his.
You know, his his his His item shrinks down, and it's just really I'm fulfilling.
That's all it is.
So here we are where we just crossed the four minute mark.
Almost.
All right.
So how man?
Oh, man.
The holes that we dig ourselves.
17 95 that I Frankenstein start The movie is I Frankenstein.
It's directed by Stuart Beattie.
Hot Space Who wrote Collateral?
What happened, guy?
He's written a lot of movies.
What happened, guy?
I don't know, man.
You get the opportunity to direct something that's just too tasty.
Yeah, but you go in.
You know, you start with the worst material anyone can have.
This is based on a comic book.
All comic books, Agreed thing.
Yeah, no incorrect.
Most comic books shouldn't be made into movies, especially ones written by the guy who wrote Underworld is one of those, like when you call a backdoor comic book.
Yeah, this is not.
It was published by dark store entertainment or some such thing are their corporate offices.
Someone's garage it.
It's gotta be like, you know, it's just Mirage's You know what I mean?
Like, BC comics.
Maybe yes, seriously.
Ah, bark horse.
But you've got to You're kind of taking darkhorse comics and Wild Storm comics, putting them together and making an unsuccessful output.
What is Wild Storm comic?
Rather, an imprint of D.
C.
They used to be an imprint image.
They've done like Wildcats.
Do they have to do on Lee comic book titles that have Wild Wild Ranger's, the color book adaptation of Wild Hogs, the comic book adaptation of Reese Witherspoon Wild Wild Things adaptation with David Lynch's, well, that heart that would make a pretty good comic.
And if he's really Charlie Sheen's Wild Thing, the comic series from Major League So wiling out with Nick Cannon, What is that?
I don't some youth show that existed before, you know a few years ago, also, new listeners were collectively 408 years old, just like records.
Yes, Frankenstein.
Uh, don't you mean Adam?
I mean, I Frankenstein Frankenstein, a k Adam dealing its name that later by a bunch of gargoyles.
Thistles.
I think the first movie had show history where I watched it, and I couldn't really remember the plot.
I was like, What the hell?
And then I read it online.
The Wikipedia plot description.
Yeah, I was like, Okay, that's what I had was one big Sure.
Pencils down.
I've watched this twice now.
And if it wasn't for Wikipedia, I don't think I'd have a handle on it.
Because the first time I watched it, I had the exact experiences you did, Eric, which was Wait, what was that movie about?
Like seconds after it hit credits.
So the eye frank, it's done.
You know the story of Frankenstein?
Um, this ain't your mama's break.
It's It's not.
It's a lot cooler.
You know why?
Because your mama's Frankenstein didn't have gargoyles in it.
Right?
And the word gargoyle is like, fine.
And then you watch I Frankenstein and the word gargoyle is hilarious.
What?
We also have to address right up front.
Okay, now, Frankenstein, that you your mama's Frank Victor Frankenstein.
The doctor, All right.
But his creature was made out of, you know, pieces of corpses.
So he's like a giant, hulking, weird monster.
Correct.
This one is, like, great a U S a d beef cake.
Dude, I want to get down with this monster, but Aaron Eckhart is in fantabulous shape in this.
You said you ought to get monster Mash.
Yes, Steve, I want to get monster, man.
But how is this how you look?
A tte Aaron Eckert's shirtless body?
Oh, this is No, This is no mistake.
This isn't random pieces.
This ain't your mama's Frankenstein, Nicky, because all that monster disgusting a publication.
But that's the most handsome man I've ever seen.
There are some ugly ass pigs calling Aaron Eckhart a monster in this movie, and it's weird he makes James d look like Danny DeVito in this.
All right, you can put all the fake little scars on him you want.
That's one handsome fuck.
Seriously, like the worst that happened to him was he got a Mark Hamill car accident.
Right?
But how is this supposed to be a random assortment of body parts?
These are all the best.
And you know what?
That was one thing, but I was thinking about Is this movie better?
And I think it is if you just put a little nightcrawler makeup on.
Amis is green, you know?
I mean, he looks like the same thing would be green because it looks like, Oh, he's otherworldly, like that's That's a monster or he's rotting.
Yeah, that's not shred flesh.
Exactly.
That's not Aaron Eckhart with who cut himself shaving in the worst possible way.
You know, here's another way.
You could kind of fix that, too.
I just thought of this you because it's all, like sections, right to conceal the stitching all over his handsome chest.
If you had, like, half of a tattoo.
Yeah, and it was, like, noticeably cut off, right?
Just like the ass end of a horse or something.
And you're like, Where's the rest of that horse?
That was from a different dead body.
Maybe.
Have you had, like, a nation arm in a black arm?
And exactly, Just mix it up a little bit, get a Dracul arm and there may be you definitely need to drag alarm if I'm making a Frankenstein is gonna have three arms.
First things first.
Free armed monster.
Yeah, and that's not even can it downstairs.
That was my question.
Does he have genitals in this movie?
Oh, definitely.
And they were, like, fully functional, like data.
The robot.
Oh, well, this is a good question.
Now, I know I'm guessing data cannot impregnate someone.
But can I Frankenstein do this?
No, I have a feeling he's sterile.
Oh, it's like dead seamen come up.
No, I just think he's shooting blanks altogether.
There's nothing there.
I was working in my lab late one night, and then what happened?
Sex Actual.
Just just sex.
Just monster mashing all night.
So it's like, you know, he tells the story of Frankenstein Pretty concisely is that I was like that.
I killed his wife, and then Victor Frankenstein followed me out to the edges of the earth and I'm a mutant monster.
And he's a regular dude.
So he died.
And this is this is the Mary Shelley's story that I mean that yeah, the following me to the north and he freezes.
That's Mary show.
Did you have very Shelly, like sitting around a parlor with her?
Her husband and her sister just telling the story then and then he freezes.
That's wonderful.
Oh, I didn't get to the gargoyles.
Yeah, you know, Mary, just shut up.
Yeah, it's fine, right?
The editor like this is a perfect place to end the kind enough here.
This other 700 pages you don't need, we can keep it to 110.
We'll put the gargle.
Well, clearly you have.
Mary.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Shut up, Mary.
Shut up!
If you have a write another book, maybe you can.
You can use gargoyles, then also another great thing about the word gargoyle After you watch this movie putting gargoyle in front of other things.
Very hilarious.
They say things like Gargoyle Army in this movie.
Gargoyle queen.
So I started doing it.
The other thing.
Things right.
Like a gargoyle restaurant.
Or like a gargoyles only bathroom.
That is discrimination.
I would be happy to discriminate against a gargoyle cause they're jerks in this movie.
And they're not like that sexy voiced cartoon show.
No, no, no.
Keith David to be found.
Why not?
You know, throw a bone to keep David won't know I could spend a few days since my my Saturday morning cartoons.
Now gargoyles in general, stone creatures of it sitting on the top of cathedral.
I guess these guys turned to stone ish a little bit like stone monsters.
The problems.
They're all the same gargoyle, Which bothers me.
I want to see, like, one with the long nose.
One with big years.
Well, with Groucho Marx mustache.
Sure wants the gargoyle queen.
Speaking of putting things in front in right after gargoyle, the gargoyle queen has like a white marble to her.
It's very nice.
It's very cheap.
There's so much cheapness in this movie.
Yeah, this this is the thing.
If you don't have money, Thio make your movie look good.
Don't be making a movie with computer gargoyles floating all over the place.
Exactly.
This looks like a Nintendo 64 you're already doing demons will get there.
But come on, it's it's You got the creature.
You got the demons.
You got the gargoyles.
How is there not one hell damn ass Dracula in this whole movie?
I mean, I get it like Van Helsing was really stupid.
And he, like, integrated all of those things into that movies.
I think like the sequel would have been Dracula's fighting if more than four people went out to see this movie.
One of that, one of them was Steve, By the way, the city I did see this in theaters.
Um, you know, Hey, look, some people stay up late to watch in a lunar eclipse.
Some people go see I Frankenstein.
Hey, that's fine, man.
Just qualified a show research.
You can use it as right off.
Yeah.
Advice, taxes on your deathbed.
Um, Speaking of crossovers, watch McCall.
Kevin Goro, who wrote the comic and the movie Want Who wrote the Underworld movies, wanted to have Silene show up at the end.
Kate Beckinsale's Elise stop it as in a Stinger Seem like it.
I Frankenstein Avengers, I think literally everyone who heard that idea from Selene on down thought it was terrible.
I think it's great.
I want a Will they or won't they?
With this hunky monster?
He is the sexiest monster of all time since Brad Pitt played a vampire.
Oh yeah, since Antonio Band Eris played a vampire since Tom Cruise played a vampire.
Oh, that was all in the same movie was it.
Steven, right?
No.
No.
So Steven Rae looks like everyone's grandmother.
Doesn't, eh?
Yeah, he does, actually.
And it's that old Irishman smelling those baseball caps in the S V U episode, you creep.
That's John Savage.
Oh, that's John Sandwich.
What?
Steven Rae doing?
He's He's a even in this view as well.
He Yeah, I think he's one of those high score and pedophiles on that show, too, of so many.
So you Frankenstein is just like, wandering the earth, you know, feeling bummed out that he murdered this woman without really much any come up, right, cause he got mad that he was created.
So he just murdered this innocent poor woman.
Then Victor got mad at him.
Yes.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're mixing it up.
Victor promised him that he was gonna build the creature.
A maid.
A bride of Frankenstein, right?
Yeah, Bride of Frankenstein I bride.
He promised that there would be an eye bride Eric, and then he reneged on the deal.
And so then the creature got pissed off and killed the wife saying, If I can't have I bride, you can have your bride.
Oh, you know what that you that works.
Thanks for clearing that up.
But that makes total sense because he's got all this dead genitalia.
Uh, he needs to match it with other dead.
Jim.
I don't know how much it is about monster intercourse is it is about having a body for the end of the world.
Yeah, but you got a bunny, buddy.
You could get a buddy anywhere.
I would love it if it's just a creature like Aaron Eckhart's hanging out with a bunch of money or or it's like a Harvey s creature.
He's like seeing this rabbit.
Okay, Frankenstein, do you see that huge rabbit in the hallway?
Oh, fuck.
A gargle.
Oh, no.
A demon.
Jimmy Stewart hags himself because he could handle the rabbit.
But gargoyles, Frankenstein's demons no call to silly.
Oh, that's what they call movies nowadays.
Glad I've been dead for almost 20 years.
Uh, well, it says what it is, though, is like the prologue of this movie is the end of the book.
Yes, and it gets up to, like, literally the end of the book.
Like I went back, I buried him and I hate his rotten guts.
And then some gargoyles showed up and sub demons were fighting me like it's such a It's such a like a shitty you know, It's like it's like one of those improv exercises where they're like, All right, we're gonna get to the end of the story and then tell you what happened next, you know?
And it's like And then I don't know.
Some demons start fighting in the graveyard.
It seems like it's a setup based out of bad improvs.
These demons are like bad Battlestar Galactica.
That bad Babylon five Monsters like that.
The makeup is so terrible, it's terrible.
It's like Season one.
Buffy back.
Yes, exactly.
Really bad animation.
And it was just got extra horns every which way.
And it's like, What's the point?
You know what I mean?
Like, you're supposed to be like a hell demon look like it and honestly, like, you know what?
Those ghost writer, nobody liked those ghostwriter movies.
So why would anyone like to sign Frankenstein movie, which is almost the same thing?
It's It's good was writer, but you can't be bothered to have a Nicholas Cage or be a motorcycle.
That's the only two reasons I'm going to see those movie lose lose its terrible.
So So, Yeah, The whole thing is he slays a couple of demons and then these gargoyles air like, Wow, we never saw.
We never saw a non gargoyle kill a demon before.
What's that about?
And then Aaron Eckhart just runs away.
Then he's like, Oh, we have to We have to go to the gargoyle queen than Aaron at Cards.
Monster laughs for 10 minutes, though.
Susan, that's a real thing that my boss, what is with like the sick gargoyle pen has that they all live in to where is this supposed to take place, he says.
We go back to where I was from the world of man and that, but that could be any.
It's like Europe.
Question mark.
Yeah, well, it has to be here.
Well, it's Europe.
Yeah, but they don't specify.
Like foggy old London town.
Gail Perry, Where Transylvania are we talking?
I mean, there's no monuments of any Kano and everyone speaks.
Complete American English means something.
I just got it, guys, What's like America?
What's like your butts?
Canada, not the movie was filmed in Sydney, actually, So Australia, you know allowed this to happen.
That's fine.
We won't hold it against him.
We love Australia, but certainly we're not in Australia because no one's using an accent.
Everything's American everything.
But it's also specifically European looking.
Nobody drives a car.
So you know what, what on what side of the road we're Nobody drives a car.
And you know what else is really weird about this movie?
For the most part and, you know, catch me if I'm wrong here there are no like extras.
Any Wellit's a vacant dead city.
It's a Ziff.
The place was was, uh, vacated and reconstructed by David Fincher.
Because every day you get everyone out is like that.
I'm gonna put all these green lights here every which way.
This might be like a dark city floating city, it in space.
It's entirely possible because there's no one who's not Ah, Frankensteins a demon or a gargoyle running around, except for the one human, the lady scientists there and her assistant.
So that's two people.
Once we do get a couple extras in one scene where we were, we're following I Frankenstein back to the world of man.
He's like, Oh, some things have changed like he's looking weird at people's clothes and stuff and some things are the same.
And he's like, people are drinking alcohol in this bar.
If you would still do that, we don't know.
Does he eat?
Does he drink?
Does he piss?
We don't see any of it and for the most part, because I was trying to catch if he was intentionally doing it or not.
Yah, Not a lot of blinking from Aaron Eckhart Gas movie.
Very a lot of like just droopy face staring at things.
It's really unsettling in the worst way.
Not even the good unsettling.
Yes, said the gargle Queens like, Look, dude, we don't know what to do if you want to hang out here where the only other people in the world and he's like Yeah, no thanks.
Gonna get some cool weapons, though.
And it's like, Oh, uh, gets like these Steve Blackbird kendo stick and he starts walking around pretty bad as dude.
He's just looking like a shit ass Nightwing through this whole movie with these sticks.
X man, these electro sticks.
It's stupid and you know he walks off.
I would kill demons because I have so much rage, I'll never take another human life.
But these demons, these demons, will do you It sounds like he's going through some stuff.
I don't think he should be killing any, you know, even demons, like settle down, monster.
Yet you got eternity.
Why don't you just, you know, learn to live peacefully?
You should have learned to go fly fishing or something.
He does say at one point during this longer than I'd care for narration that, like, after he escaped, he tells the gargoyle clan, you know, to go screw I'm my own monster, you know?
So he gets out of there, and he basically says, Like, he goes to all the corners of the world to, like, hide and just be alone.
Yeah, but that the demons would not leave him alone like he tried for peace and quiet.
But those those rowdy goddamn demons come following me.
Well, we find out later.
It's because demons want to.
Apparently, demons can only possess people who don't have souls.
And they're like, Oh, shit, that guy doesn't have soul.
And they were going around or they just find him.
Hot is really good looking, dude, right about that.
Dude, if I could get mine devil Magic into that body, Dude, that's what unstoppable all they want is just a little monster mash man.
That's all they want anyone wants.
Unfortunate.
This movie never gives it to us.
No, it's no, Honestly, it starts, like, kind of flirting with Will this monster get romantically linked to this human woman?
Right?
And I was like, Don't you don't you?
I don't.
This woman could do way better than a monster.
No, I wanted it to happen because I've been dying for the Franken baby.
I want to know if it works and I want to see it a thing.
Get born.
Well, I guess you get right to Ah, well, all around Renaissance man Kevin Djourou and ask him to do a second script.
I'm sure he's got three scripts, Jack of all trades.
Master of none.
Yeah, you're probably right, Steve.
It was an intended trilogy added to the list of trilogies that will never get made.
God bless it.
Uh, so he just he starts fighting other demons.
The guard.
He goes back to the gargoyle queen now in the modern era, and we know It's the modern era because he's wearing a turban Outfitters hoody the whole time.
Where did he know to get that snazzy haircut?
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Second question.
Is his hair like a doll hair or doesn't grow back?
Is that the last haircut he's ever gotta go get?
Oh, my God, I think you're right.
That's not growing back.
No.
Yeah, that's it.
That's the end of his was the head of a criminal.
He has to be very careful with his head.
Exactly.
You got lucky.
I mean, that's a pretty perennial haircut, Classy over the side swoop.
But like, that's it.
That's it.
You got it.
You get really pissed.
It's It's hot.
In the summer, you get a buzz cut, enjoy that buzz cut.
So December 29 29.
Now that's the thing that I think it is a fairly manageable hair cut.
It could take you through all seasons.
Look it back if you want, but with all the rowdy adventures that he's have, and I wouldn't be surprised if one day he gets himself caught up in an explosion, that hair burns off.
That's the end of it.
Say it is.
So then you're just wearing a wig.
The wrist.
I got a feeling the monster would not ever problem walking around bald wasn't a Nero's monster Bald do.
His monster was messed up, man, was it bald, though He was bald, just like everything was all in the wrong place.
And that's a monster.
You would not have sex.
That's what makes sense for a Frankenstein creature.
Exactly looking all gross.
Well, that's things like there's like, Oh, there's the whole, uh, the treaties of this film is This ain't your mama's Frankenstein right?
There is a difference between and having tohave the bolt on the neck of the Flathead, you could find another design.
That's not just like windswept hair and beautiful blue eyes.
Yeah, you know what?
Director of this movie, why don't you go ask Sir Kenneth Bran about making a monster?
He'll give you a couple of notes, and you could take some of them.
Probably not going to take all of them.
You don't want I Frankenstein to be three hours long.
So now we're fighting on the side of the gargoyles again.
Yeah, he's with the gargoyles.
They fight.
There's just so many times the gargoyles fight the demons.
And it's like, Wait, why?
Who exactly What are we looking for?
What look like?
It's what's the thing?
What?
Okay, here's they did add some cool things to fighting.
All right.
Okay.
Now, when the gargoyles kill a demon, it descends, which has a fire trail behind it.
And that represents him going back to hell forever.
Yep.
That's one winner.
Gargoyle dies.
I always I always thought I always thought that these gargoyles would probably be more of a demonic in nature or something by the nasty appearance there.
Gargoyle.
No, no, no, no, no.
They are send when they die and a beam of light comes and they go to heaven and play with the angels, or they get abducted by aliens.
You don't see where that do You think the aliens are abducting the moments before death?
And like, yep, that and then they resuscitate them and brainwash them and give them a nice brain scrub, and then they make them part of their growing alien army.
But you know what else gets script to Ben?
They probe.
Oh, I was like, What?
They're gargoyle balls.
Where you going?
You know like you.
They haven't, you know?
Well, at least the first couple of guard girls are getting inspected.
Yeah, they personally want to know.
Yeah, what's the deal with gargoyle?
Genitalia?
Says Jerry Seinfeld, is this hilarious like X plot of, like, this guard, this gargle guy, this gargoyle girl that, like, have a secret love affair.
She's one of the battles, like they both get stabbed and he dies.
Then she's like and then, like for I Frankincense, let me help you.
Oh, I don't know how to take care of a guard girl.
What's going on in there?
You go blood or you know what?
Offer rescinded.
Stay there.
I'm gonna You have gargle doctors or what's the prophetic?
And she's just like, No, I'm sick of this horseshit.
Let me die, Apparently in heaven or in gargoyle heaven at least like you can get down to some sex, really.
But well, that's what she says.
She's like, Listen, let it was forbidden on Earth.
But having everything's gravy exactly anything goes.
Dude, it's like Vegas.
You're telling me Win creatures?
Yeah, having all types of crazy sex in the Kingdom of Heaven.
That's what I Frankenstein leads me to believe are angels snippy to gargoyles, You think?
Why aren't they just fucking angels?
And I saw my wrong here.
The Angels v demon.
You know something I could get behind.
I get it.
You got wing right?
Because I think that that Da Vinci Code guys suing you No.
But I also think Dan Brown the most American fart name of all that I own angels and demons.
Sorry.
You're gonna have to pay the piper.
The literary piper.
If you want to have, we'll just use gargoyles.
Thank you.
But here's the thing.
Angels air lame.
And this ain't your mama's Frankenstein.
So then your mama's angels there.
Gargoyles?
How cooler Gargoyles.
Never once, though, did I look at a gargoyle?
And I was like, You're an agent of the Lord God, I Look, I wanna watch you for a night.
Demented sister.
Cargo.
I want to see what adventures you happen to get out too.
I see a gargle and I'm like, you're a brick.
Basically.
Just sit there for the next 100 years and shut up.
You think that's why Hye Ji I Courtney was hired because he's a brick?
A series of bricks and Oh, my God.
It's just like a cargo.
I look at him, all right, Let me let me let me run something by you guys here.
I want to see if it works on you.
Okay?
Picture JJ, I Courtney in this movie or in live free or die hard whatever you want to do.
And you got dry Courtney in your head, right?
I forgot what it looks like already, but go on.
So he looks like a guy that probably listens to a lot of Jack Johnson, right?
Oh, yeah, right.
He gets down, he listens to some shitty music or a lot of new metal.
It's one or the other with Jacko.
You know, when he's when he's rolling up his ride.
That's a new metal.
That's new metal time when he's lighting a bonfire on the beach.
Johnson.
Yeah, exactly.
I think he's always grow friends leave.
He puts on the Jack Johnson.
When the bro friends show up, It's like, Hey, let's listen to break stuff by Limp biscuit.
A lot that making movies with Bruce Willis lot.
I could just see it happening.
I can't I don't know the other guard little cleaned, by the way, is Ah, poor old Miranda Otto of Lord of the Rings fame.
Yeah, that's just like, Oh, sorry, lady.
Um, I feel like they just you Sometimes when you cast a movie you Dr upto like Emerald City comic con.
I like your figure migrant workers to work out a house.
And you're like, Hey, who walks in like, you know, whoever is there, just get on today.
Do you think she was like, Oh, man offered to be an I Frankenstein dials a phone.
Oh, hey, Peter Jackson.
You sure there's no room for me in any of these Hobbit movies?
You got not ours to fill your paws.
You could just cut back, see what I was doing beforehand.
Hello?
Well, I Frankenstein it is.
What?
Oh, my God.
Wouldn't know they'll be stupid.
You're a gargle queen.
Ah, see, it's it's a hot property because it's not an iconic role yet, You know, she could make the gargoyle queen like a new pop culture.
Zeitgeist like an you know?
Yeah.
You know, you thought Dracula was cool.
Now we all know we're all talking about gargoyle queen.
What?
We're all fighting over.
Who's gonna be the next James Bond.
Meanwhile, who's gonna be the next gargoyle queen?
Also?
I'm sure she has a dumb ass name that no one can possibly remember because everyone's Either you're just a gargoyle or you're not a gargoyle.
That's that's how I look at this movie.
What is with the deal with Guard girls?
Just naming him Adam.
That's the gargoyle queen's job because all the other guard girls like it.
It it the creature, the creature.
And she's like, No, I see humanity in him.
I shall name you Adam.
I don't understand the pronoun.
It's not like Oh my God, I can't even understand what that thing It's a fucking dude.
Yeah, it's a dude with a dude haircut.
Do jacket, dude slacks, do Jews.
And why doesn't he identifies human?
And why hasn't he named himself yet?
He's been walking the earth for hundreds and hundreds of years, and he's I never thought of an alias Paul Frankenstein.
Okay, so what happens when Frankenstein goes into, like a Starbucks or something?
And they asked him.
His name is he's never had an alias.
He's just going to say, creature, I'm creature.
I'm creature.
Yeah, he's coming up with something I feel.
Yeah, that's that.
Are comma Frankenstein on Dash's Frankenstein.
I, Colin Frankenstein.
You are not getting on this airport unless you talk straight with me, huh?
Isn't Idot Frankenstein like that?
Well, that I died.
I am.
That is what it should have been injured.
When i dot Frankenstein on icom a Frankenstein.
Ira Frankensteins, so, like it comes to it, comes to pass the bill Nye He dons this movie, and I just just just darkens the doorstep of this poor movies having prestige.
Oh, man.
And just like I don't know what Kevin did.
Did Kevin Drew, like, just go through his garbage one days?
Oh, you'll be in every movie.
I want you to be in power.
It's Yeah, it's totally possibly found out.
Bill Nye.
He was in all sorts of embarrassing debt.
Yeah, and he was just like, you know, you're gonna come make this movie, right?
Cause Kevin Drew has a hilariously deep boys, and he was just like, Well, whatever could you mean I would never be in your dumb I Frankenstein movie?
Oh, yeah.
How about that American Express card bill away?
Kevin Drew's the big dude from Steel and all those things.
Yes, said the voice of Satan himself.
Yes, same guy.
It's the guy.
He's in his own movie.
I got it.
This is a movie adaptation that he wrote from a comic book.
He also road.
That is what's happening.
And I love that he can't even write himself a better role than just, like anonymous Heavy number seven.
Dude, I wrote a note somewhere that he in every movie that he's been in has had a line.
That's something like, Boss, everything is going to play or or the opposite of Yelich, Sir, we've hit a snag like he has those like henchman lines and everything.
Agent.
Now that Michael Clarke Duncan is dead, You think I could get in there, get a little Ah, there's a gap in the world.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, And you ain't gonna fill it, pal.
We're gonna get Dennis Haysbert for Sid City too, if you don't buy.
Did they really?
They did.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
I got to see it.
Nobody wants.
Is he playing the same character that Michael court Don't get shot up, All right?
Yeah, I just thought I was available.
If they would have put that in the trailer, maybe I'd have seen it.
As it stands, most people didn't see that talk about things.
No one wanted a second since it.
And if you were going to do a second Sin City, do it in a reasonable time after the 1st 6 Exactly.
It's like being in a bar and everyone was like shot shot shot shots and you do over you having a great time?
And so they totally let's do some more.
But then, like, they have to go get their wallet and then you're like, Put your coat on.
You're like, Dude, it's It's that the time passed like we're all tired.
Go home.
The sitter has to be let out.
You're gonna order another sin city.
I got one foot out the door.
We'll know yet that he'll order for you.
And you.
You leave the bar.
You're in your early twenties on the dude wakes you up in the middle of the night.
You're 35 he's like, I got it, man.
I got that same city you wanted.
Who are you?
I want you.
In 15 years, we all thought you were dead.
Turned out you were making another sin city.
Ah, we had a funeral for him.
Everything empty casket through the ocean.
We're not doing Sin City's anymore in the way of the bullets that I got Kids, man.
I mean so, like, basic Oh, Bill Nye Guy shows up and he's old powdered Bill Nye esque.
He, by the way, is a demon prince.
They know beer IUs.
Come on, give me anything.
It sucks Smiling at the devil.
Why, like, is it so impossible for Bill Nighy to be the devil?
That'd be great.
But that's what this showdown needs to be taught in the fact that all these things keep descending.
Del, how about we see the main man?
You want to see middle management?
If the devil's involved, I could maybe buy gargoyles Maur.
Yeah, because it's like you've already Okay, you've raised the bar to such a level that the devil's involved.
I will be more willing to believe all your godly good magic, right?
Well, actually, the devil was going to appear in the third installment of I've set up Kevin Bureau also.
Why do I Why did you have to be a prince of hell.
Aki's 98 years old as it stands.
Just 100,000,000 years in hell time.
Like I feel the same way with Prince Charles.
Like honestly, after you turn like 68 years old, you're not a prince.
Maybe you're a baron.
Maybe Switch it up.
It's so shoot it so dim.
You native of a term, You look like such a dumb ass.
You're this old ass man walking around being called the Prints.
It's embarrassing.
It's embarrassing, Prince Charles.
That's why is now the artist formerly known as exactly a child to term.
But what he's just waiting for his father to die is his father.
The devil is he is He will not hear Prince Charles because Prince Charles is waiting for his mother to death.
Both know his mother did.
All right, So there will be one of England.
But was his father the devil?
Prince Charles Possibly Okay.
Now was building Maur possibly CRA z Z.
I think I don't know how being a principal would have to be.
Or maybe it's just like an honorary title.
Love to be right?
Yeah, because who's his mother then?
Like Come on, You're just put it too much into the pot.
Given grow.
It doesn't make him more important or bad ass.
Um, a villain that he's also some sort of vague royalty.
You can still give him a goon status report.
If he's the devil, if he's the devil, if he's a Barrett of l, it would have to be a prince for your good status report.
Do you think that original in the original script because he wanted this zinger to be put in at the end of the Stinger?
Rather, uh, do you think Bill Nye he was supposed to be playing that same vampire character for those movies for, like, part of the shoot.
And then he was like, Oh, no, Kate Beckinsale won't be in the movie.
Hey, Bill, you're not a vampire anymore.
Oh, I guess I won't adjust my performance.
Adults.
Oh, lucky for you, Kevin Guru.
My vampire performance is very similar to my Prince demon performance.
Maybe it's like the clubs.
The third movie and still night.
He had six different roles, but they're all this vampire prince, a goblin King Satan and a vampire.
Perfect.
I would love that.
You show me a bunch of Bill Nye.
He's in a room yelling at each other and like like monster hissing down.
I'll watch that.
That's better.
Why?
Franken's you put a record on in that room.
You got a monster, man.
They're probably trying sex stuff with each other totally.
And then Kevin grew.
You truly have yourself a box office graveyard smash.
And then you go to the room bosses.
Everything's going to plan.
Scratch that.
Something's come up.
That's another one.
Something's come up.
Guys said it 12,000 times on camera.
And you know what a perfect opportunity for a Caligula ask orgy would be a demon movie.
That's true, because they, you know you got shirtless and be more cakes already in this movie.
But the thing is, they don't do it.
The demons who don't really do anything evil aside from Try and Kill Frankenstein, which I don't necessarily think so bad thing.
No, there shouldn't be that monster Roman Street.
He's an abomination.
He's affront to the Lord in Heaven and all the gargoyles that serve him.
So no, it's weird.
The guard girls and him have a weird dynamic that got handled a love.
Hate Frankenstein.
You mean you're Adam Adam Frankenstein?
Yes.
The titular eye of the Phil Mitch Frankenstein?
Yeah.
What about him now?
Oh, he's got a He's got a rocky relationship with a gargoyle.
Yeah.
Yeah, they love one second.
Hate him the next.
Apparently, he accidentally kills a human being or no, he is accused of by the gargoyle order.
No, he totally kills Frankenstein's Victor's wife.
You know, nobody was me, like, don't think to turn on him for, like, Oh, no, that's right, because you know you're right.
So what happens is the thing is it it doesn't matter.
Everyone know it doesn't matter.
I just recalled what you were talking about.
So at one point, like he comes back to whatever city this is supposed to be and he pops into this fucking gargoyle order like Kramer like he's always just pop it in and pop it out.
Yeah, he comes in, he makes a sandwich.
Any lead, is it?
Applause.
But yeah.
At one point, he goes after because he's looking for Bill Nye.
He is a good thing.
He doesn't know what Bill Nye he looks like.
He knows the name.
New Beery is, and he wears no Burian s.
He's putting on his two face voice in this movie.
And so he's hunting for Tiberius, and he's getting, after all these demons and the demons kind of run out of this nightclub because all of these movies, they're hanging out in nightclubs.
Blade.
We're in nightclubs, underworld movies and nightclubs all over the place.
So we're in a nightclub.
These demons make a run for it.
So then what Eric is referring to is, ah, cop comes out of nowhere, sees them fighting, and he's like, Hey, you guys knock off that horse and around over there.
And then the demon comes up, breaks this cops neck.
So then the gargoyles get all pissed off a Mitch Frankenstein, and they're like, Hey, man, Ah, Human got killed tonight.
That's fucked up.
And I had nothing to do with it.
It was Batman's fault.
Yeah, so that's what they're blaming.
Yeah, I guess they get really pissed off when when humans get killed.
But thankfully, there in this city where I think there's five humans, that cop got killed those four weeks.
Maybe that's why it matters more thing.
This is not like a regular city.
People are gonna notice on the other side of the movie, The Lady from Chuck, who's like the scientist she's like she's doing like Victor Frankenstein esque s ask experiments and for Bill, not he who looks like the most evil fucking the galaxy.
And he keeps going.
Is everything going recording to prom?
And everyone's like, Oh, I think I would be working for Satan.
Yeah, she's so close in this movie I would love for her to, like, go home and let you see your log on to Facebook.
And she's just like, Oh, rough day at work today.
Sometimes my boss can be real jerks, Frowny, emoticon, cheese.
It's like I'm working for the devil or something you would have to know because he keeps coming back being like, when were these corpses be reanimated?
She's like, I don't know, boss, that she's like talking about sis and shit like No, no, no.
Clearly this guy does not What the cure.
Paralysis?
Yeah, No, exactly.
Like so they're working on a rat, and they're like trying to charge this rat back to life and, like, kind of gets a little bit of a heartbeat going on.
It's not exactly like running all over the place, but, you know, for a first running it, Okay, you know, bad.
And then you build my heat like walks out of the shadows and he's like, I have a puff of red spoke how long until we get to a human subject?
And she's like, Well, you know, um, human bodies are a lot more complicated looking than wrap bodies, and he's like, Tell me about it and then, just, like, goes back into that red cloud.
One of the McGuffin in this movie is Victor Frankenstein's journal O G.
And it's just like that has all the secrets to how to reanimate the dead and what not.
And one of the dumbest things I ever heard was She's read in this journal, and it turns out he used electric eels as electricity to reanimate.
Right, Mister I Frankenstein, right?
Yeah.
Well, the other thing about it is, and yes, it's stupid.
Like, where did he get electric eels?
What was he in water like?
How does it work?
You look a bit like a cartoon.
Get him all riled up.
You've got a lot of fish, fish eggs all over his body, and they apparently sting him like bites.
Adam just enough.
And then, like, shoots electricity into his heart.
Well, it's so stupid, like she's sitting there going over like what it would take to reanimate a corpse of a human being.
Because she's like doing She's doing the math and she's like, Well, you need such and such amount of electricity.
I don't even you couldn't harness electricity like that back then you couldn't generate it, so I just I don't even know how this would happen.
And Bill Nighy is like, Let's say there was someone who once successfully did this and she's like, Yeah, you keep talking about this Frankenstein urban legend.
When I guess in this world, you know, it's it's not a it's not a book.
Clearly, it's like it's a comic book.
I wrote that carpet, but we know Kevin.
It was pretty great.
I thought, good enough for a movie or three.
And yes, so the whole thing is like it's the urban legend of Victor Frankenstein brought a man back from the dead, blah, blah, blah, And he's like, right, But so say that was a book that explained the step by step, how you could accomplish this.
Would you want to take a look at it?
And she's like, Yeah, but it's fake, and he's like, We'll see about that in a few hours.
How are we doing on the book, Kevin Guru?
Yeah, we're doing okay.
Uh, give me a couple minutes to report back.
I mean, like, if you're working on a spreadsheet, your boss comes by and he's like, you know, Frankenstein was really well, I'm going to start looking for another job.
Clearly, this is not the place for May know this is a clown outfit.
I don't know what the fuck this guy's getting up to, but it's none of my business.
But it's so tempting because all this equipment in this spooky secret lab is pretty high tech.
It is.
And she's got, like, a lab assistant or a partner or whatever, and this guy's got no qualms about working for the devil.
He's not asking any questions.
Bald scientists slated to die.
It's a moving money talks and bullshit walks, man, the fucking check cleared.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll do your corpse reanimation research.
Just keep paying me 65 grand a month.
Demons pay well.
They dio gargoyles minimum wage below minimum wage because somehow you earn tips.
I don't know what that deals.
Well, you know the thing with demons having so much money because they're working all off all that, you know, expired currency.
They've been around for so long.
They're just full of the balloons, right?
They probably all kind of Confederate gold.
Nazi gold's all kinds of gold.
That was, you know, accumulated through various ways, right?
No beery ISS ways the word Theo Theo Guys have bees, A business demon, The gargoyle queen gets kidnapped and Giant Courtney's dumb as a sack of bricks is like, Well, all they're asking for is the the book this novel by Mary Shelley Barnes and Noble Get the Penguin Edition Classic.
It's 5 95 that much.
Dude, that would be awesome If this was a world much like the world of Dracula 2000 where there is, like, the Bram Stoker book and they're kind of like Ha ha ha!
Isn't that funny?
Vampires, right?
If they did that in this movie, and it's like ha ha the Mary Shelley book.
Yeah, they really got all the details, right?
Like if it was that kind of world, then Gee, I Courtney pulls a Marty McFly in back to the future, too, and he switches the cover of Victor Frankenstein's novel with the Marriage, The Diary rare with Mary Shelley's novel.
And then he's just like like The Demon Prince is just thumbing through it, and he's like This looks more like a work of fiction than anything.
And then he just opens.
The coverage was like, Ooh, la la class discussion notes.
What is it?
But I mean, so he's like, All right here Here is the most valuable piece You've been chasing this guy for thousands of years.
We have no idea why, but here's just a book anyway.
Just take it.
Whatever Frank and Sun comes around to get no big Old Frankenstein fight, the Fighting sucks because it's really like fast motion and super cool.
We're looking like a shitty video game.
That's all it is, And it's terrible animation, too.
So it's like like I said, it looks like n 64 that's where most of the movie like word we're getting into the nitty gritty here.
But the majority of this movie is just dumb fights with dumb JJ I, Courtney's dumb face moving around and you don't want me honestly for the other scenes that aren't fun.
But I wanted to hit extra skip could tutorial.
You know what I mean?
Like, totally.
Just give this cut scene.
Did you guys know that in the world of this movie, there's been a centuries long war going on between demons and gargoyle?
No, Really.
Do they talk about this dumb ass war at least every five minutes, Like at least every five minutes, It gets brought up in some capacity, the war between demons and gargoyles.
And it's the whole, like, generic.
Like we We have to defend the light against the darkness.
I'm like, you're just saying a bunch of nothing like, Do you wanna know why no one understands this movie because it's just the most based, like black V white shit.
It's so terrible.
But like that also brings up again.
How does angels fit into this?
Did the angels lose?
God was like, I need to make a more gnarly thing to fight that maybe the angels are like conscientious objectors.
You know what I mean?
Like It's like they're peaceniks up in heaven.
Yeah, just spoken reefer.
Flower children like like like the rush of Quakers.
Well, yeah, you know, Yeah, gets think it build a barn.
They could put up a nice heavenly bar.
Now they're like, Richard Dreyfuss is he's going up to, Ah, Canadian heaven.
That's Ah, more American graffiti reference.
Yeah, you do with that What you will.
I'll be over here talking about Maura.
American graffiti gets killed in center Canadian heavens.
But but that's the thing is like, what?
What does God think about all this?
It just seems like a waste of time to have a bunch of gargoyles fighting a bunch of demons.
Like, just go down to St settle this shit.
Just go talk to him.
You know?
It's like it's like, you know, when When Don Corleone is gonna he has that meeting, right?
He's like, Listen, we gotta stop killing each other looking fucking pointless.
I just don't want to deal heroin anymore.
Like, just have that kind of a meeting like, I promise I'm not gonna hurt any your guys.
You promise Your guys are gonna hurt any of my guys.
You do your thing down there.
I'll do my thing up here will leave Earth as the middle ground.
Nobody needs it.
Look at all these pigs anyway.
Isn't there any status updates?
Wouldn't the devil be like wait?
1000 years?
War like that's still going on.
Still unfinished.
It needs to be bumped upstairs where the boss's desk take it to higher management and get this thing solved because you're just wasting our time.
I know we have eternity, but there's other things to get done.
Seriously.
Why are we wasting time with gargoyles?
I mean, I guess that's the thing.
It's like they're not even like God doesn't even cares that let the gargoyles do what they want.
That was a big mistake on my part.
You know, if if you win, if you went to me 2000 years ago when you were like God, what are you doing?
And I was like, I'm just making some gargoyles.
Well, they're these stone things that can come too late And think about calling him gargoyles.
I would have asked you to tell me that.
That's a bad idea, because these gargoyles are my worst invention of all time.
I have nowhere to put them on this idea there.
They always need a place to live.
I said go.
Go.
Okay, you guys go, go, go to the top of the church and just take a load off and yeah, yeah, yeah, That's your job, Gargoyle.
Just guard this building.
There you go.
That's your job.
And that's why you can't go into a church when someone has asylum in there.
Because the gargoyles will come to life God's decree, right?
And murder Anyone who attempts to to violate that hollow, ground, hallowed ground.
Oh, what did I say?
Hollow ground.
That's just a hole.
Well, that's where I Frankenstein came from.
So this woman is there.
The doctor is there during the fight.
Bubble blind.
All this shit happens, he kills a demon.
No, Nobody cares at all.
The plot barely inches forward.
In this movie, she goes, he great.
I Frankenstein grabs her from behind with fingerless gloves and says, Don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Yep.
That's when my heart explode.
Is anyone any hulking figure with fingerless gloves?
Grab your throat and tells you to be quiet and they're not gonna hurt you.
Get your rape with a loud Get it out, Get it wet.
Well, you know what?
But then she turns around and sees that it's handsome as hell.
Aaron Eckhart.
Oh, no, He was telling the truth.
There's no way this beautiful man is goingto arm doesn't goto I Frank decides apartment, you know?
And it's just like of course, he's living in a burned out something around.
Yeah, sorry about the mess.
Do you want anything to drink or something?
Look, could I get you something I've got?
I've got sugar free iced tea that's about Here's some rainwater from a puddle.
That's that's all I got.
I got that Ed Microwavable White Castle hamburgers.
You?
No, no, don't worry about the living room.
We could sit on my bed.
We'll watch the movie in there.
Yeah, you know what?
That light's broken.
It's just never worked.
But you're supposed to watch movies in the dark anyway, right?
I mean, right, it works, right?
I love that I'm Frankenstein lives with a burned out warehouse, but somehow it's still got a functioning DVD player and a TV feed way.
We're saying he's basically human, right?
Of course he would All I have is one copy of Good Night.
Good luck.
It's a movie, you know.
That's what newscasters meant.
Something not like today's news media.
You know, I'm sorry to get all political out.
Let's just watch the movie.
I just never thought that we'd come to a point where honest reporting was more rare.
That gargoyles, that's what changed the most of this world is the news.
So anyway, she she's like, Oh, I believe in you.
I Frankenstein you're the good guy and the gargoyles of the good guy.
It's such like my father such or I would be hard pressed for undead creature to sell me on gargoyles.
Well, he says, Gargoyle queen, just like Oh, okay, there's one part in this movie, and it's amazing because it's almost as if Aaron Eckhart is talking to the audience, sitting in the theater, watching this movie because she's she expresses some sort of doubt about something or other.
And he was like, Listen, this is all happening.
It's really okay, like the movie stops and he's like, Look, just just buy it, all right?
Just please just buy it.
It's almost over.
Just pleased by it.
Thank you Can we please finish this movie?
I know it's the dumbest thing you've ever heard, but it's really it's happening.
Ah, and he's also kind of interested in leg if she could help him out because, like, he's got the diary and he's reading through like I have to see how I was created.
Also, you might be able to make me a mate.
That idea lasts for, like, 10 minutes, not even instantly thrown out the window.
If you're not gonna be my girlfriend, maybe you could hooked me up with one of your dead friends.
You know what?
Maybe you could make me someone that would sit and watch.
Good night.
And good luck with me.
I told you that light never worked.
Why does everything have to be a scam?
Frankenstein getting shot down on a date?
I'm taking my jacket off.
And my sweater.
It's hot.
There is one are in that scene where because he's got a shirt off for some unknown, though you know the reason.
And she's just, like, sit on the bed.
I said, I'm a bad Please sit on the bed.
And I was like, Now you're not gonna kiss.
I Frankenstein, are you?
Is that where this is going to necrophilia?
Baby, that is necrophilia.
Don't you doubt it?
Do you think it's cold?
And that would have to be I mean, I guess so.
Right?
Corpse, But in order.
Well, maybe it's not functioning because don't you need blood, Thio?
I don't know how this fucking thing where expanding its act like I don't know how his muscles flex at all.
It's just history's mysteries.
You're totally right.
You put away the p 90 x when she came in.
Yeah, man, P 90 x Send that back to a couple of years ago.
Five way back to Nordic tracks.
I've Frankenstein as a NordicTrack because he's been around so long.
A shitty Roig visits eighties.
Oh, yeah.
Totally good old wooden rowing machine.
Absolutely.
And the and the excuse is always it still works.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I still get exercise.
Would it matter to you what I use?
Um oh, so Jake Kourtney gets killed at one point for no reason because he's trying to assassinate I, Frank, because she what's basically I Frank it's done in one of his Johnson.
He basically He's like, going around tow the three locations movie multiple times, like at a press.
Like you got to think.
No.
Okay.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.
You stay here.
Nobody, please, Nobody move.
I'm gonna be back in 10 minutes.
I can't keep doing this on one of his johns to Bill Nye.
He's science lab.
He goes underneath and finds an army of I Frankenstein.
Oh, man, this is This is this is where things get, really students like the Matrix.
But of course is you are like like the Borg.
It's just this impossibly giant room.
What kind of a base situation in this office building are we talking about?
Bill Nighy?
Thousands and thousands of thousands of these things all just sitting there waiting like they put they basically put a ah pentagram on their head.
Set it and forget it.
Like you get a nice, evil marinated ratio.
Is issuing a devil doctor do it?
Always doing his pentagrams on people.
I guess it does.
Oh, and the devil doctors played by somebody to he's kind of a famous actor is, uh, not a famous actor.
He's like one of them that guys can't recall right now.
Point is, he's a devil doctor.
Also, the weird thing about this is like it is like Steve is not using hyperbole when he says thousands like there's thousands of corpses in these little Devil sacks like The Matrix, like just sitting, waiting to jest State and Bill my he has some comment about like, Oh, yeah, these are all real corpses And I was like, Well, there's thousands of people down here.
How is that?
Like where everybody went in this city killing people.
That's why the streets are barren, except for gargoyles and demons.
Well, it's been hundreds of years.
Apparently they've been collecting because all they need is the is the colonel's recipe on How to Make a Fucking Frankenstein died and they've been waiting hundreds of you.
Look, Bill.
Nice, but very patient.
He's like, All right, well, just wait.
We'll wait it out.
There's got to be a journal, will catch.
I Frankenstein will just chase him around.
Year after year on, we'll just keep amassing these corpses.
At least we're making progress in that air.
Time comes.
We have the corpse.
Would you rather not have the corpses, or would you rather have the corpses.
The funny thing is, once they once you the big secret she finds out she got this whole set up.
It's all electricity.
It's just a frequency of electricity.
You give me a day, look in some frequent.
It's either 5000 volts 1000 volts.
Whatever.
I'll try a mall, and I'll get it, baby, You know, what are you waiting way Would have gotten by by now if it was that simple.
Exactly.
The rest the world we would all I know about this.
Like, are they afraid they're gonna, like, overcook?
Um, like, is that the idea?
Thousands of corpses figure it out.
Just bring one up to that laboratory I have to keep looking at and just try it out exactly and make it and make it a lady one.
And then you could have a scene where the lady evil Ah, dead body could try to seduce I.
Frank.
It's dude undercover corpse.
Yeah, you could.
She'll be like, Oh, yeah, I made you that.
That woman you wanted Oh, yeah, Secretly from Siberia.
Ce right.
And then they'll be like, she'll turn on him, and then he's gonna be forced to kill another woman.
Dude, I would love it if they start dating.
And she keeps talking about, like my dad, my dad, my dad.
And he's like, You know, we've been going out for six months.
I think it's about time I meet your family.
You keep talking about this, Dad.
I don't even know his name.
And then she just turns to the camera, and she's like his name is nigh Iberia's and she attacks him.
She's playing the long con they've been dating for six months.
Be perfect.
That'd be great.
Unfortunate.
That would probably make this movie longer than it's refreshing.
98 minutes.
Really, Sheila, Even after that long weekend in the country thistles.
What?
It was all it was a game.
A whole long I'm just a stupid game.
Do you?
Um I just a bad a stupid bed.
I mean, about with your devil dead.
The other thing is, he never owns up to kill in this lady, like even the devil.
Even the woman doctor, you know, in his sexy apartment, he was like, I had to kill Victor Frankenstein's wife because she was looking at me cross.
And she's like, um, so you kill Anybody else knows just the one woman.
I mean, you know, a deal's a deal, you know, like, Okay, one time.
I told you I only kill demons now.
Yes, that's right.
She said something about like, Well, have you killed anyone since then?
It's like only team ends.
I was like, I know.
But then I killed another woman.
Well, I moved.
Seriously.
The guy was a total dick.
It was a good alert is lessons that killed his wife.
He told me he was going to do one thing, and then he didn't do it, so I killed his wife.
What?
It's so complicated about this.
He was the scientist.
I didn't know you guys had to be signed to figure it out.
It wasn't a mistake.
No regret it or regret it hung somehow Somehow, even though he is the biggest dick in the paranormal universe, somehow he magically has a soul.
At the end of this year, after all the rigmarole, nothing works.
Because somehow that rude monster who has no regrets for killing that movie that woman for essentially no reason, just magically has a soul.
I stupid I think that was you know God watching him being like he's taken out more demons than my goddamn gargoyles.
And I made these gargoyles to take out demons.
You know, gargoyles.
You could take a note do from my Frankenstein over here.
He's got quite the work ethic.
Shut up!
God, actually, I did kill one other woman.
I was working in a restaurant this time, and this guy ordered, like, $300 worth of sushi that he left me an entourage DVD.
So I killed his wife.
Well, least that would make sense.
My God.
Entourage on DVD.
I would've smote him a CZ.
Well, see the preview for that movie.
I did not.
But I man, that's gonna be something that is a must Miss isn't as big of a must miss as Mark Wahlberg's The Gambler.
It's a bigger must miss the Mark Wahlberg The Gambler is a y.
Two words.
John Goodman.
Yeah, John Goodman's in the GAM and he's supposed to be really good.
Far as I know, John Goodman is not in the Entourage movie.
And isn't that director on the short list to take over Star Trek?
Who?
The gambler, The guy who directed that?
Oh, easy, right?
Like, uh oh, interesting.
I thought they confirmed the Star Trek director.
Oh, did the Maybe not.
All right, so history's mysteries.
I Frankenstein, we're still the The war is still raging on everybody.
So basically, she has the book.
She gets kidnapped again because she's a woman.
She's like she's his sidekick for, like, three minutes and then gets kidnapped.
Obviously right Sidekick for three minutes.
Bad date.
All of a sudden, I Frankenstein, let's forget kidnapped again.
Miranda Otto's like, Oh, gee, Courtney, you go kill him, you kill I Frankenstein because after 100 and 50,000 years, I realized that if the demons want something, it's probably easier just to kill the fucker like it's.
But we also had this exchange not more than 15 minutes ago in the movie where they had the whole thing of like, I'm going to exchange the diary for Miranda Otto's safety and release from the Demon Army.
You know, something?
Something.
I mean, that's gotta mean something in the whole scheme of how she feels about I Frankenstein.
And then all of a sudden, she's like, you know what?
On second thought, why don't you?
I kill him because I am tired of this.
So he goes and he tries to kill I Frankenstein.
They have a little bit of a fight.
Courtney ambushes him.
Yeah, totally un unmemorable fight.
It's a video game fight.
It is.
And then at the end, like it's one of those things were like we both fall down and oh, my God, I got stabbed with something you think I want But, oh, there's white light coming out.
He starts to shake like he's getting the quickening, and it turns out it's just a beam of light coming out of his back.
Oh, now what?
You what you would imagine just due to, like movie history.
Like how that would work was he was had this little blade.
Gotcha.
Because the whole thing is to kill these these these demons or these gargoyles.
You just have tohave like this dumb little symbol on whatever you're sticking into somebody sure it's like a cross, but with, like three like cross lions instead of one to the Greek Orthodox cross practice.
Yeah, it turns out that's the true religion, right?
It's always the green card the whole time, So that's what you think right.
They fall off this roof, and he's like, totally stuck you with this little pen knife with the cross on it.
No, no.
Somehow, by falling off of this roof, like during the fall, Adam produces this huge acts out of nowhere.
And that's what Jake Kourtney falls off with his own act.
You've always known it is all in the tumbling of it was, ah, hoisted by his own petard, huh?
Here's the thing.
If God loves I Frankenstein so much right, which he clearly does, it gives him a soul at the end of makes it a real boy, right?
Why is Jake Kourtney going to heaven for trying to kill him?
You know what I mean?
Like if you're ready.
Oh!
Oh, shit.
I didn't know I Frankenstein was the one true son of God.
And you know what?
Not to nit pick.
Oh, heaven forbid.
But technically, if he's falling on his own acts like you say, that's Ah, suicide, you gargoyle.
And even with gargoyles, suicide's a sin to hell.
You go, JJ I Courtney total flub.
They used the wrong light color their rug Director Gary, did you?
Oh, you hit f eight That's the gargoyle ascension.
Not the demon descends you.
No, no, no, no.
It's gonna cost more to go back and redo it.
Yeah, he's just gonna go to heaven.
Bucket.
Nobody on the podcast point this out A year from now, he'll just be up there hanging out with Hitler.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Gary, we know you gave him with a white light to you idiot man.
A flashback scene where I Frankenstein and kills Hitler and for some reason to get It's a light.
Like everybody thought it was a suicide in the bunker.
They didn't know Frankenstein.
What's there?
Turned out Hitler was a demon.
That's right.
Germany elected a demon boy were their face is red.
It was.
It was either He was the first prince and Iberia's is the younger young girl.
Oh, you think my beard.
This was the backup to Prince Hitler?
Yes, in terms of anti Christ.
So sure it goes Hitler, Liberia's Maryland man thing.
The three anti Christ man.
Even the devil would think it's so cool to put those names together.
And I mean, you know, whatever.
So like, I'm I'm confused as to what battle were up, Thio useless battles.
So let's get to the last one.
So basically, um, Liberia's has the lady.
He's got the He starts his big his big, stupid like a circus machine of all these I Frankenstein's And of course, they have little status is from 1% all the way up to on Oh, you need those Progress Bar's for what?
Like when would?
Here's the thing if I'm making a When did you make these things, like in the twenties and then in the auto?
Yeah, that's see, That's a big problem, right?
How are you?
If you've been preserving these corpses for hundreds of years, As you say, you have been right.
When did these little Elektronik nesting sacks come into play complete with progress ball?
That's the thing is I I am not.
I don't care who Tiberius, my boss.
Anybody's like, Hey, Steve, you gotta go and put little doo hickeys on all these dead bodies on these thousands of dead bodies because it would make more sense For what?
Why do we Why do we need to watch their progress?
We'll know when they get out.
You know what, Steve?
Though you're a salaried employee and That's intern work.
That is it.
No, it in Siberia.
Get one of his new Iberia interns to do it.
A great twist would have been once the status by wants to and it opens up and they're just all skeletons.
My period, you hear their frosted?
It turned out Liberia's Hide the Three Stooges to be the maintenance guys.
They got Jason and the Argonauts ready so you won't sign me up.
Go, go all the way.
Give you some scary skeleton.
You know what?
You know what Liberia's.
Here's when your monster's done When a giant thing bursts out of his sack than it's finished.
I don't need a countdown.
I don't need a percentage tab.
It's so dunk.
I'm Torrente ing all these souls.
Only a 50% maybe Asian toward less sold at once.
You know what?
There were so many people leeching this soul right now.
Why don't you fucking cde people seeing that soul soul seek, But they do that purgatory.
There's gonna be plenty of, like, lawless souls, like not claimed yet.
Yeah, like you looking for a good time Soul.
Why don't you come up to Siberia?
Icis sold sack.
So they're all going like one, too.
Oh, my God.
And, you know, like as a human being and anyone that's ever seen a movie like, obviously before they get to 100% something's gonna have something's gonna happen.
And that something is a bunch of gargoyles burst in and start just killing these things.
Well, they're following.
They're all pissed that I Frankenstein killjoy, Courtney.
So, like they're following him to kill him.
And then, uh, Miranda was like, Oh, no, he's leading us to the demon layer.
He was on our side the whole time.
It's like, when was that ever?
Not an option.
He just doesn't like you.
Essentially, they made Frankenstein.
Villa G o Jimbo, Why is always playing both sides?
So is no.
He was actually on our side.
What you need in this story about highway, which the first time I watched this movie I was writing, I was so not comforting.
I mean, yes, you need ready.
I was so not comprehending the story.
Speaking of good writing that when jj I, Courtney, like, attacks him, I thought Jake Kourtney turned on him.
Yeah, and I was like, How about that guy Courtney's gargoyle turns out he's working for night.
Beer is good to twist.
Yeah, he's got all the devil books.
Exactly.
Turn that shit.
That's honestly what I thought happened.
And then this time I was watching, I was like, Oh, wait, he didn't turn.
Oh, he just accidentally killed himself.
Oh, that's stupid.
It's like burn after reading.
Yeah, a gross disappointment.
Well, I think this was a bigger disappear, so yeah, because I was so anticipating Night Franken's Dutch Kevin girls like, Oh, I'm gonna go out there and kick I Frank could start task.
There's like rolling up his big date demon sleeve.
And of course, he gets killed by gargoyle on in second.
Right?
And that is one of the dumbest gags of all time.
He's like huffing and puffing and getting ready to get out there.
And this gargoyle just swoops in like a pterodactyl and picks him up and rips off his demon head.
Bill might get some demon timers.
Well, in this room, that is about the time.
So, like all the gargoyles and demons are fucking and fighting each other outside of nobody chicken and fighting gargoyles and demon.
And you know, I Frankenstein burst into the lab where Bill Nye, he and the scientists are there and building Lahey gracefully bows out, let a stunt man coming.
And he's like, Thanks, but no thanks.
That's a wrap on Bill Nye, everybody.
He's just a He's gonna look like a weird, demonic goat head for the rest of the movie.
So we're getting Bill in there?
Not Bill Nye.
He builds Stevens in the stunt double.
We understand how this could be confusing for everyone.
Get in there, Bill.
Not you, Bill.
Other Bill.
Oh, this was a confusing idea.
And then yeah, this goat face motherfucker just gets in there.
He starts like, giving him shit for not having a soul.
And he's talking about, like, you know, I'm gonna set up shop when I set up a cool demon in your body and it's gonna be great.
And, you know, we're gonna make all the eye, frank.
It stuns march all over the world and blah, blah, blah.
And Adam has the greatest blood of all.
Which is the gargoyle.
Order must survive and mankind with it.
I was something that someone was paid to say.
You know what?
Honestly, why is there no room for demons in the situation.
Why do the gargoyles have we win?
There just is ugly.
Whoa, yeah, one up.
Just mankind.
How about mankind shows up at the end of the movies like there's there's men Soldiers, too.
Yeah, they are.
And they kill, the guard goes.
It's like enough of this paranormal shit.
Yes, the Ghostbusters show that every grain that's it.
Turns out in all this time like, let's say, this movie takes place in like, Yeah, 2135.
The Ghostbusters have been building up their own Ghostbuster Army for just such an occasion writes.
It was like the four original Ghostbusters started it all right, but they've been recruiting and recruiting and recruiting.
There's a Ghostbuster ROTC like it's the real deal for four star generals anymore.
Finally, by the way, yeah, dude, And then the other Ghostbuster Army just comes in and lays waste to all those demons.
400 guys have the same wisecrack at the same time and then credits man wins over both sides of this.
There's a definite I love this town.
Ah, cacophony of I love this town.
Dude, I love this town is the Heil Hitler of the Ghostbuster.
You just say I love this town.
How are we doing today?
Everybody?
I love this town.
Good to hear your right.
It's nationalism akin to the national Socialist.
That is my report, Herr General.
I love this town over and out.
Well, glad to hear things were going so well.
I got it.
I love this town.
Ah, so then whatever.
Bill my He's fighting with him for a little bit.
Try to do a little column a shock today on, you know, And then this wall, let me tell you something.
All of a sudden we're casting spells in this.
Yeah, I don't think so.
It's too late.
It's way too late.
All of our magic is predicated on electric eels and force lightning and cum food and a lot of kung fu magic wand sticks.
But at no point did anyone ever Kali Ma's shock.
Today in Cast a spell, you can't introduce spell casting in the last 15 minutes of a movie.
But then we get like, literally and it's my favorite thing that Aaron Eckhart does, which is scream like an idiot.
I wrote down his scream in this movie and in Dark Knight.
He's got the most hilarious screen, but it's like eight minutes of it, because they keep cutting back to Miranda Otto like breaking all the little i Frankenstein's downstairs to keep cutting back Thio.
Dude, the sound of Aaron Eckhart getting his ass kicked is one of my favorite sounds like some people will tell you like, Oh, I don't know church bells, you know I'm like birds in the morning.
Yeah, right.
Like, give me a loop of Aaron Eckhart screaming like an idiot in this movie, Ma.
Oh, it's the best.
So that's when we find out Oh my God, he has sold the whole time.
And Bill, not he's like, No, and he he kills him and build I He's whatever you know, you get killed is a bad guy.
You do a little loop the loop and go down right to hell.
But, Bill, not he's a prince of hell, Right?
So this is gonna be a big fat loop.
The loop, right?
He also kills him.
But by cutting the Greek Orthodox cross into his body Oh, that's right, gets murdered because he's got, like, three scratches across his chest and then I Frankenstein's Oh yeah, who just like, scratches him down the chest.
And then I mean, he dies so hard he destroys a castle like explodes so bad.
After this loop, the loop an Empire Castle falls into the grounds.
There's four loops loose.
Apparently had four souls the whole time.
Yeah, I really don't understand how this villain works is a quad soul and the the little I Frankenstein doctor down there, By the way, setting up a little secret sequel, Kevin Grow, is because he takes a flash drive before he skips down.
Oh, doesn't get a little spells on notice.
That's really terrible wishes.
There's some bad, Um, and it's with Bill Nye.
He It's with all of these demons when they do like a a demon's getting angry thing and like they want to show that they're demons.
They do like little red lights in their eyes that some of the worst, like M s paint special effects of all time.
It's just It never looks good because all you're doing is working on a real person.
You're not putting contacts, and you're just like shading the colors of their eyes.
Yeah, so this whole thing happens, a castle collapses on these people.
It's one of the biggest computer explosions I've ever seen.
And somehow, like the Blues Brothers, you just adjust yourself seriously like Miranda Otto, like, flies out of this hole with I Frankenstein and the scientists just like hanging on.
No way.
Maybe I Frankenstein because he's a monster.
And who knows what it takes to kill him.
But that woman is dust.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Like a nuclear bomb went off, Ladies, Dawn brings out an arm.
Havens are like a fine.
Maybe she dies and all of a sudden, Oh, she Frankenstein, you know, that's what it should have been doing.
Resurrect her.
That's your teaser for the ending.
That's your teaser for the next movie.
It's I, Lady of Frankenstein.
Exactly.
Are I Bride of Frankenstein, for instance.
If she accepts, I want to see a scene where I Frankenstein's poppet, the I question.
And it is I turned down.
I mean, but you're pretty obligated if somebody resurrects.
You know that's the problem with resurrecting something.
Not so when when you're not in a committed relationship, it's kind of a shitty movie.
Yep.
You know, Adam, I would but it's eternity now.
And also I just just met you.
I met this wolf man and he's pretty cool.
Oh, yeah, do the wolf man in the Hawaiian shirt.
Oh, man, it would be a big fat party animal.
All that would boil his blood.
It was dead blood.
That's what I want.
This year we've had a Dracula movie of Frankenstein movie.
Let's get a big fat party animal Wolf band.
Kevin James as the Wolf Man.
I would watch it.
I would totally watch it.
By the way, that the guy playing that evil devil scientist is, um, what's this for?
It's, Ah, New Zealand actor Bruce Spence, the dude from Road Warrior, and he's in like, Yeah, that guy, That's the devil scientist in this movie.
That's what you said.
It's set up for a big role when he takes that flash drive with all the you know, all the torrent of souls on there can't believe more people weren't see.
Eden could have had so many more souls off the with so many leeches.
It's ridiculous that the souls seven out of 10 quality could have been a little bit better.
And now this.
It was pan of the whole time.
How shit this cells.
Just a camp file.
It was in a kettle B A would screen at.
Oh, shit.
This cell's got a water mark on it.
Damn, it's got a big monkey on it.
It's stupid, man.
So they mentioned something about how he's got too much, have some higher purpose not explained at all.
We are delights, not Mario brothers Bad.
But we are setting up a sequel at the end of this movie.
Well, that's the way you were waiting for Kate Beckinsale.
The show, like suit up by Frankenstein.
I fare Well done.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe this.
You know I don't believe this.
I know that's what it is, right?
She rushes in and she's like, we gotta get out of here.
And he goes, Why?
And then this year Oh, and he looks up in.
It's a full moon.
I shrank and credits party animals out there.
Got a murder of a murdered is a party animal.
They him and what's her name?
Selina.
Selina Lean.
I think they end up murdering him with a speed ball.
Like a silver speed.
Yes, the trick that murdering a party animal where Wolf is.
You got a party harder than totally.
But that's the thing.
That's great.
The European and I Frankenstein.
Dude, you got no blood.
You could go all fucking night long.
That's true.
He could out party a party monster where we'll see the werewolf can die.
He cannot die.
Advantage.
Frankenstein.
Exactly.
He can always go toe one more bar.
You know, the world is a man I don't know about this one.
Frankenstein.
I just I was I was kind of follow to sleep with that last part.
No man would go to one more bar down the street.
So he's got this big speech.
At the ends of big voiceover speech.
I descend er of the demon ord.
I, my father saw I Frankenstein lightning you Seriously, dude, it's so stupid.
He's the beginning of that is something about like, I'll be here for when the forces of darkness return.
And I was like, Why didn't you just vanquish?
But I thought All right, I guess there's more villainy against.
That's the reason you don't put Satan in your first movie.
You don't put the cart before the horse, all right?
Like I kept telling you.
Satan supposed to appear in the third film of the trilogy.
Also portrayed by Bill Nighy with a mustache possibly portrayed by me, Kevin Guru with a bigger bust on the horn.
Man, this movie stinks.
Is anyone gonna recommend this to someone?
Is this a seeing?
Is believing situation?
No, I mean, it's just honestly, if you've seen a bad action movie from the last 10 years, You really?
If you've seen one of the ghost riders if you've seen one of the later blade movies Yeah, you've got it.
You really got it all.
If you saw the blade TV show, that's pretty close starring sticky fingers as blade.
That's a thing.
Sure you could watch that instead of I Frankenstein.
I guess you could.
Would you, Eric, would you recommend Is that was a no from Steve, you know.
Okay, So you're no on your You paid big money to see this, right?
But it was a big money wrestling.
I would not recommend this, Uh, because of reasons cited within.
I'm saying no.
All right.
The point is very good.
I would not recommend it either.
This is ah, incredibly stupid movie.
Um Yeah, it's It's kind of hard to follow to.
It honestly, is hard to follow.
Even if you're paying attention to it, it's hard to follow.
I mean, because it's so well defined, like, Why would gargoyles and demons fight each other like, you know, that that never you know, I just don't make up cargoes become angels, and we're fine.
Exactly.
The fact that it's gargoyles is what sinks this movie because every time you say guard everything else, every time you say gargoyle, you lose three seconds of my attention selling man that stupid.
It's just It's like you're listening to the audio book on the train and someone's talking too loud.
I gotta rely on that.
Yeah, I mean missing it.
I think I got it.
Maybe when an angel gets its wings, it just turned to do a garden.
It's like a It's a God is like a monkey's Paul.
It's everything is gonna be like a twisted Clarence.
You are.
Your wings don't know.
You're a bunch of Gordon.
You know a Clarence.
Please don't visit me a Christmas anymore.
Your horrifying my whole family, where you dress like a robe in secure it.
Ah, fuck it.
That's five Frankenstein from the past year.

Yeah.
All right, Steve, listen, I got a gun to your head, Kevin.
Grow.
It's in your house.
You know, he's got a girlfriend that Kevin grow is coming from within.

Yes, it is.
Yeah, you're damn right.
That's a cool 90 minutes.
Well, in un cool night, you could say a lot of things about my script, but their brief I get in and I get out.

Ifwe I just All I saw was he is with the gorgeous.
He's a green and black regular Frankenstein once.
Yeah, and he's got a gun.
